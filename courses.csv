AA 47SI:,Why Go To Space?,"Why do we spend billions of dollars exploring space? What can modern policymakers, entrepreneurs, and industrialists do to help us achieve our goals beyond planet Earth? Whether it is the object of exploration, science, civilization, or conquest, few domains have captured the imagination of a species like space. This course is an introduction to space policy issues, with an emphasis on the modern United States. We will present a historical overview of space programs from all around the world, and then spend the last five weeks discussing present policy issues, through lectures and guest speakers from NASA, the Department of Defense, new and legacy space industry companies, and more. Students will present on one issue that piques their interest, selecting from various domains including commercial concerns, military questions, and geopolitical considerations."
AA 102:,Introduction to Applied Aerodynamics,"This course explores the fundamentals of the behavior of aerodynamic surfaces (airfoils, wings, bodies) immersed in a fluid across all speed regimes (from subsonic to supersonic/hypersonic). We will cover airfoil theory (subsonic and supersonic), wing theory, and introduction to viscous flows and both laminar and turbulent boundary layers, and the topic of flow transition. At the completion of this course, students will be able to understand and predict the forces and movements generated by aerodynamic configurations of interest. Assignments require a basic introductory knowledge of MATLAB or another suitable programming language. Prerequisites: CME 100 and CME 102 (or equivalent), PHYS 41, AA 100, and ME 70."
AA 108N:,Surviving Space,"Space is dangerous. Anything we put into orbit has to survive the intense forces experienced during launch, extreme temperature changes, impacts by cosmic rays and energetic protons and electrons, as well as hits by human-made orbital debris and meteoroids. If we venture beyond Earth's sphere of influence, we must also then endure the extreme plasma environment without the protection of our magnetic field. With all of these potential hazards, it is remarkable that our space program has experienced so few catastrophic failures. In this seminar, students will learn how engineers design and test spacecraft to ensure survivability in this harsh space environment. We will explore three different space environment scenarios, including a small satellite that must survive in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), a large spacecraft headed to rendezvous with an asteroid, and a human spaceflight mission to Mars."
AA 109Q:,Aerodynamics of Race Cars,"Almost as soon as cars had been invented, races of various kinds were organized. In all its forms (open-wheel, touring car, sports car, production-car, one-make, stock car, etc.), car racing is today a very popular sport with a huge media coverage and significant commercial sponsorships. More importantly, it is a proving ground for new technologies and a battlefield for the giants of the automotive industry. While race car performance depends on elements such as engine power, chassis design, tire adhesion and of course, the driver, aerodynamics probably plays the most vital role in determining the performance and efficiency of a race car. Front and/or rear wings are visible on many of them. During this seminar, you will learn about many other critical components of a race car including diffusers and add-ons such as vortex generators and spoilers. You will also discover that due to the competitive nature of this sport and its associated short design cycles, engineering decisions about a more »"
AA 118N:,How to Design a Space Mission: from Concept to Execution,"Space exploration is truly fascinating. From the space race led by governments as an outgrowth of the Cold War to the new era of space commercialization led by private companies and startups, more than 50 years have passed, characterized by great leaps forward and discoveries. We will learn how space missions are designed, from concept to execution, based on the professional experience of the lecturer and numerous examples of spacecraft, including unique hardware demonstrations by startups of the Silicon Valley. We will study the essentials of systems engineering as applicable to a variety of mission types, for communication, navigation, science, commercial, and military applications. We will explore the various elements of a space mission, including the spacecraft, ground, and launch segments with their functionalities. Special emphasis will be given to the design cycle, to understand how spacecraft are born, from the stakeholders' needs, through analysis, synthesis, all the way to th more »"
AA 131:,Space Flight,"This class is all about how to build a spacecraft. It is designed to introduce undergraduate engineering students to the engineering fundamentals of conceiving, designing, implementing, and operating satellites and other space systems.

Positioning techniques using code tracking, single and dual frequency, carrier aiding, and use of differential and assisted GPS/GNSS for improved accuracy and integrity. Students will learn the building blocks to go from raw received satellite time in nanoseconds all the way to a sophisticated position solution. Using provided Android smartphones, students will collect data and implement an open-ended course project where the goal is to get creative and solve an interesting problem using the tools developed in this course. Prerequisites: familiarity with matrix algebra and MatLab (or another mathematical programming language)."
ACCT 542:,Corporate Taxes and Business Strategy,"The goal of this course is to provide a fundamental understanding of the principles of business taxation and tax planning, which will be relevant and valuable even as tax laws change - over time, across borders, and by taxpayer type. The role that taxes may play in business decisions are presented within an ""all taxes, all parties, all costs"" framework, from the tax issues at start-up (e.g., the choice of organizational form for a new venture), multistate and multinational operations, financial accounting implications, and mergers and acquisitions. We will use cases to gain hands' on experience analyzing business tax strategies and refer to financial statement disclosures as appropriate so that you can learn how taxes affect the financial reporting for transactions. A recurring theme will be linking the tax strategies that we learn with concepts from corporate finance, financial accounting, business law, and economics."
AFRICAAM 37:,Contemporary Choreography: Chocolate Heads 'Weather Simulator' Performance Project (DANCE 30),"An interdisciplinary project-based class to develop dance technique, collaborative choreography, and associated visual and musical arts. We invite dancers, movers, and emerging creators of all styles and backgrounds. The Autumn 22-23 project will focus on creating a ""weather simulator"" as a vehicle to explore the relationship between weather and human social life. We will use improvisational scores, meteorological data, gaming and machine learning strategies to both become weather and respond to weather. Through this poetic simulator, we will devise a collective way of thinking about our survival and our creative agency. How does weather change our way of being? How is the weather affected by human behavior on earth? In an unpredictable world of climate catastrophes, how can our simulator inspire hope through collective imagination grounded in science? The Chocolate Heads will continue the practice of creating intermedia performances using dance, film projection, technology, and live music. We are seeking interdisciplinary artists in dance, poetry, music, graphics, video and AI. All levels of experience are welcome.

This class is an arena for physical and artistic exploration to fire the imagination of dance improvisers and to promote collaborative and interactive intelligence. We will draw upon dance styles and gestural vocabularies, including contemporary dance, hip-hop, vogue and more. Students will learn how to apply these improvisational dance ideas to generate and innovate across disciplines. Accompanied by a live DJ, students will practice listening with eyes, ears, and our whole bodies. Open to students from all dance, movement, and athletic backgrounds. Beginners welcome."
AFRICAAM 60:,Spoken Word Poetry and Resistance: 1990's-Present (CSRE 42),"In the 1990's the Spoken Word movement exploded onto the public scene in multiple forms. The decade marked the birth of the Poetry Slam movement, the 'Golden Age' of rap, and the re-emergence of Poetry as Performance. In the contemporary moment Kendrick Lamar's Pulitzer Prize-winning album, 'DAMN', Mahogany Browne's anthemic poem 'Black Girl Magic', and the rise of online Spoken Word platforms like 'Button Poetry' are all evidence of a similar present-day uprising in the centuries-old Spoken Word tradition. This course will combine workshop and seminar approaches to provide students with space to read and examine the Black Spoken Word tradition from the 1990s to the present, and to write and perform their own work."
AFRICAAM 78:,"Art + Community: Division, Resilience & Reconciliation (CSRE 78)","Violence and trauma isolates and segregates us. Part of the healing process must be about coming back into community. Freedom is meaningful only insofar as it lifts all, especially those who have been done the most harm. In times of violence and polarization, art can heal and brings people together. In this course, we will explore how we make and sustain community, especially in the face of threats from within and without. We will do this especially through examining how artists and culture workers of color develop and advance practices that build mutuality, criticality, renewal, trust, and joy in the face of ongoing racial injustice and cultural inequity."
AFRICAAM 111:,"AIDS, Literacy, and Land: Foreign Aid and Development in Africa (AFRICAST 112, AFRICAST 212)","Foreign aid can help Africa, say the advocates. Certainly not, say the critics. Is foreign aid a solution? or a problem? Should there be more aid, less aid, or none at all? Africa has developed imaginative and innovative approaches in many sectors. At the same time, many African countries have become increasingly dependent on foreign aid. How do foreign aid and local initiatives intersect? We will examine several contentious issues in contemporary Africa, exploring roots, contested analyses, and proposed solutions, examining foreign aid and the aid relationship. As African communities and countries work to shape their future, what are the foreign roles, and what are their consequences?"
AFRICAAM 121B:,"""The Will to Adorn"": An Anthropology of Dress (ANTHRO 121B, ANTHRO 221B, ARCHLGY 221B)","This seminar explores sartorial practices as a means for examining formations of identities and structural inequalities across space and time. Building off the definition of dress, pulled from Mary Ellen Roach-Higgins and Joanne B. Eicher, this course examines sartorial practices as social-cultural practices, shaped by many intersecting operations of power and oppression including racism, sexism, and classism, that involve modifications of the corporal form (i.e., scarification, body piercings, and hair alteration) as well as all three-dimensional supplements added to the body (i.e., clothing, hair combs, and jewelry). The emphasis on intersecting operations of power and oppression within this definition of dress draws on Kimbrel Crenshaw's conceptualization of intersectionality. Through case studies and examples from various parts of the world, we will explore multiple sources of data - documentary, material, and oral - that have come to shape the study of dress. We examine how dress intersects with facets of identity, including race, age, ethnicity, sexuality, and class."
AFRICAAM 151:,"Ethical STEM: Race, Justice, and Embodied Practice (ARTSINST 151C, CSRE 151C, STS 51D, SYMSYS 151D, TAPS 151D)","What role do science and technology play in the creation of a just society? How do we confront and redress the impact of racism and bias within the history, theory, and practice of these disciplines? This course invites students to grapple with the complex intersections between race, inequality, justice, and the STEM fields. We orient to these questions from an artistically-informed position, asking how we can rally the embodied practices of artists to address how we think, make, and respond to each other. Combining readings from the history of science, technology, and medicine, ethics and pedagogy, as well as the fine and performing arts, we will embark together on understanding how our STEM practices have emerged, how we participate today, and what we can imagine for them in the future. The course will involve workshops, field trips (as possible), and invited guests. All students, from any discipline, field, interest, and background, are welcome! This course does build upon the STS 51 series from 2020-21, though it is not a prerequisite for this course. Please contact the professor if you have any questions!"
AFRICAAM 157P:,"Solidarity and Racial Justice (AMSTUD 157P, CSRE 157P, FEMGEN 157P)","Is multiracial solidarity necessary to overcome oppression that disproportionately affects certain communities of color? What is frontline leadership and what role should people play if they are not part of frontline communities? In this course we will critically examine practices of solidarity and allyship in movements for collective liberation. Through analysis of historical and contemporary movements, as well as participation in movement work, we will see how movements have built multiracial solidarity to address issues that are important to the liberation of all. We will also see how racial justice intersects with other identities and issues. This course is for students that want to learn how to practice solidarity, whether to be better allies or to work more effectively with allies. There will be a community engaged learning option for this course. Students who choose to participate in this option will either work with Stanford's DGen Office or a community organization that is explicitly devoted to multiracial movement-building."
AFRICAAM 159:,"James Baldwin & Twentieth Century Literature (AMSTUD 159, ENGLISH 159, FEMGEN 159)","Black, gay and gifted, Baldwin was hailed as a ""spokesman for the race"", although he personally, and controversially, eschewed titles and classifications of all kinds. This course examines his classic novels and essays as well his exciting work across many lesser-examined domains - poetry, music, theatre, sermon, photo-text, children's literature, public media, comedy and artistic collaboration. Placing his work in context with other writers of the 20C (Faulkner, Wright, Morrison) and capitalizing on a resurgence of interest in the writer (NYC just dedicated a year of celebration of Baldwin and there are 2 new journals dedicated to study of Baldwin), the course seeks to capture the power and influence of Baldwin's work during the Civil Rights era as well as his relevance in the ""post-race"" transnational 21st century, when his prescient questioning of the boundaries of race, sex, love, leadership and country assume new urgency."
AFRICAAM 163:,"Fly Folk in the Buttermilk: A Black Music and Culture Writing Workshop (CSRE 163, MUSIC 153C)","This course in honor of the late, great music journalist and thinker, Greg Tate, is designed to introduce popular music writing as a genre to students from all academic backgrounds.

AFRICAAM 164A:,"Race and Performance (CSRE 164A, CSRE 364A, TAPS 164)","How does race function in performance and dare we say live and in living color? How does one deconstruct discrimination at its roots?n nFrom a perspective of global solidarity and recognition of shared plight among BIPOC communities, we will read and perform plays that represent material and psychological conditions under a common supremacist regime. Where and when possible, we will host a member of the creative team of some plays in our class for a live discussion. Assigned materials include works by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Amiri Baraka, Young Jean Lee, Ayad Akhtar, Susan Lori Parks, David Henry Hwang, Betty Shamieh, Jeremy O. Harris, and Christopher Demos Brown.n nThis class offers undergraduate students a discussion that does not center whiteness, but takes power, history, culture, philosophy, and hierarchy as core points of debate. In the first two weeks, we will establish the common terms of the discussion about stereotypes, representation, and historical claims, but then we will quic more »"
AFRICAAM 165:,"Identity and Academic Achievement (CSRE 165, PSYCH 165)","How do social identities affect how people experience academic interactions? How can learning environments be better structured to support the success of all students? In this class, we will explore how a variety of identities such as race, gender, social class, and athletic participation can affect academic achievement, with the goal of identifying concrete strategies to make learning environments at Stanford and similar universities more inclusive. Readings will draw from psychology, sociology, education, and popular press. This class is a seminar format."
AFRICAAM 169A:,"Race and Ethnicity in Urban California (AMSTUD 169, CSRE 260, URBANST 169)","The course is part of an ongoing research project that examines the consequences of longterm social, economic, and political changes in ethnic and race relations in in urban California.

AFRICAAM 178S:,"The Haitian Revolution: Slavery, Freedom, and the Atlantic World (FRENCH 178, HISTORY 78S, HUMRTS 121)","How did the French colony of Saint-Domingue become Haiti, the world's first Black-led republic? What did Haiti symbolize for the African diaspora and the Americas at large? What sources and methods do scholars use to understand this history? To answer these questions, this course covers the Haitian story from colonization to independence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Our course will center Africans and people of African descent, both enslaved and free, as they negotiated and resisted systems of racial and economic oppression in the French Caribbean. Our inquiry will critically engage with conceptions and articulations of human and civil rights as they relate to legal realities and revolutionary change over time, as well as the interplay between rights and racial thinking. Tracing what historian Julius Scott called the ""common wind"" of the Haitian Revolution, we will also investigate how the new nation's emergence built on the American and French Revolutions while also influencing national independence movements elsewhere in the Atlantic World. Priority given to history majors and minors; no prerequisites and all readings are in English."
AFRICAAM 194A:,Topics in Writing & Rhetoric: Freedom's Mixtape: DJing Contemporary African American Rhetorics (PWR 194AB),"Black music in all its genres, styles and eras has always been about freedom and transformation. About both Black people and the whole society. About the US Black experience, the African continent and the diaspora. These musical forms and the social movements they reflect and help shape are therefore central to the study of African American rhetoric. From overtly translating the ideas of social movements for mass audiences, to capturing the mood of a moment or move, to reflecting and influencing the aesthetics and styles that attend public discourse, to simply being a space where debates get worked out in community, music in Black traditions are as important a space of engagement as political speeches, sermons, websites, or even #BlackTwitter. This course will use Black music and its relationship to both social movements and everyday dialogue and debate to introduce study in African American Rhetoric as a field of study."

Often characterized as polar opposites - one advocating armed self-defense and the other non-violence against all provocation - they continue to be important religious, political, and intellectual models for how we imagine the past as well as for current issues concerning religion, race, politics and freedom struggles in the United States and globally. This course focuses on the political and spiritual lives of Martin and Malcolm. We will examine their personal biographies, speeches, writings, representations, FBI Files, and legacies as a way to better understand how the intersections of religion, race, and politics came to bare upon the freedom struggles of people of color in the US and abroad. The course also takes seriously the evolutions in both Martin and Malcolm's political approaches and intellectual development, focusing especially o more »"
AFRICAAM 222:,DESIGNING FOR COMMUNAL SAFETY (DESINST 222),"How might we design for communal safety beyond the prison industrial complex? Through recognizing the prison industrial complex as a design problem, we will explore both how established institutions (like prisons and policing) are impermanent and the possibility of designing beyond them for our communal betterment. Together with partners from the community leading the movement to abolish prisons, you will generate new design concepts of freedom and safety. You will evaluate the prison industrial complex's inability to invest in communal safety and prototype design ideas that contribute to alternative systems of justice that reject carceral harm. In order to inform and inspire our work, we will uplift and center the voices of the impacted, particularly incarcerated folks. Students of all backgrounds are welcome, directly impacted folks, and Black and Brown students are highly encouraged to apply. The class will consist of Stanford students as well as underrepresented members of the community and non-traditional students."

AMELANG 153A:,"First-Year Twi, First Quarter","Twi is the extensively spoken dialect of Akan, the ethnic group of Ghana in West Africa. Being the largest ethnic group of the country Akans have spread Twi in almost all major areas of Ghana. Therefore, it has become pragmatic for non-Ghanaians to acquire Twi if they are to visit Ghana and engage in communication with majority of Ghanaians. This course is the first/second of three levels in the acquisition of basic Akan cultural expressions in Twi. Its goal is to build a strong foundation for cultural awareness and familiarization with the Akan cultural components that support effective communication and social interaction in Ghana.

AMSTUD 41Q:,Madwomen and Madmen: Gender and the History of Mental Illness in the U.S. (FEMGEN 41Q),"This seminar explores the ways that gender and historical context shaped the experience and treatment of mental illness in U.S. history. What is the relationship between historically constructed ideas of femininity and masculinity and madness? Why have women been the witches and hysterics of the past, while men experienced neurasthenia and schizoid conditions? Why have there historically been more women than men among the mentally ill? How has the emotional and psychological suffering of women differed from that of men, and how has it changed over time? Among the sources we use to explore these questions are memoirs and films such as The Three Faces of Eve and One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. By contrasting the changing ways women and men experienced mental illness and were treated in the past, this seminar will elucidate the historically embedded nature of medical ideas, diagnoses and treatments."
AMSTUD 43Q:,Body Politics: Health Activism in Modern America,"¿Medicare for All¿ has become a rallying cry for those calling for reform of the American health care system. But this slogan is only the most recent political expression of the conviction that health care ought to be a right and not a privilege, part of an ongoing project to expand access to health care to all Americans. This course will examine key moments in the history of health care reform movements in the twentieth-century United States, considering the successes and failures of advocates, activists, and reformers who have sought to transform the medical system and secure equal access to care. Among the topics we will consider as we move through the century are proposals for a national health insurance program; the fight against racial discrimination in public health and medicine; the women¿s health movement; the disability rights movement; and efforts of AIDS activists to reshape the production of biomedical knowledge. Students will work throughout the quarter on a research-based project on a topic of interest to them, culminating in a final paper and presentation."

AMSTUD 106A:,A.I.: Artificial Intelligence in Fiction,"From self-driving cars to bots that alter democratic elections, artificial intelligence is growing increasingly powerful and prevalent in our everyday lives. Literature has long been speculating about the techno-utopia¿and catastrophe¿that A.I. could usher in. Indeed, literature itself presents us with a kind of A.I. in the many characters that speak and think in its pages. But how do we classify an intelligence as ¿artificial¿ or not? Is there a clear boundary that demarcates bodies from machines? What, if anything, separates the ¿genre¿ of technology from that of literature? What classifies literature as ¿science fiction,¿ ¿scientific,¿ ¿futuristic,¿ ¿psychological,¿ or ¿dystopian¿? And can technology or literature ever overcome the ultimate division between all intelligences¿the problem of other minds? This course consists in curated multi-genre combinations of literature, philosophy, film, and television that explore what makes someone¿or something¿a person in our world today. Special events will include celebrating the current bicentennial of Mary Shelley¿s Frankenstein (1818) in Stanford Special Collections; a possible visit to Stanford¿s A.I. Laboratory; and chatting with the ELIZA chatbot."
AMSTUD 109:,Militant Mischief: Radical Humor as Civil Disobedience in Postwar America,"It is Halloween, 1967. Thousands of hippies costumed as witches and warlocks encircle the US Pentagon to perform a mock exorcism in protest of the Vietnam War. It is 1968, and a contingent of feminists crash a beauty pageant, and allegedly burn their bras to raise consciousness about the objectification of women. As a demonstration against animal cruelty, radical environmentalists in the 1980s dump red paint on celebrities wearing fur coats. All of these theatrical protests speak to a subtradition of postwar American political activism that blurs the boundaries between pranking and protest. In this course, we will explore how American activists have weaponized humor in protest movements through the use of guerrilla theatre, pranks, hacking, and memes. Focus will be directed towards movements that are serious but not sober, and the tradition of carnivalesque activism that links the anti-war movement, women's liberation and abortion activism, eco-radicalism, and Black Lives Matter. Altogether, this course will take humor seriously as a key component in the protest movements that have sought to change the landscape of modern American culture."
AMSTUD 109Q:,American Road Trips (HISTORY 69Q),"""Nothing behind me, everything ahead of me, as is ever so on the road."" --Jack Kerouac, On the Road, 1957. From Jack Kerouac's On the Road to Cheryl Strayed's Wild, this course explores epic road trips of the twentieth century. Travel is a fundamental social and cultural practice through which Americans have constructed ideas about the self, the nation, the past, and the future. The open road, as it is often called, offered excitement, great adventure, and the space for family bonding and memory making. But the footloose and fancy-free nature of travel that Jack Kerouac celebrated was available to some travelers but not to all. Engaging historical and literary texts, film, autobiography, memoir, photography, and music, we will consider the ways that travel and road trips have been represented in American culture. This course examines the following questions: How did men and women experience travel differently? How did the motivations for travel change over time? What role did race, ethnicity, class, relationships, and sexuality play in these trips? Students will work together to plan a road trip of their own which the class will take during the quarter."

Targeted at first years and sophomores, the class surveys key issues in the development of the U.S. Intelligence Community since World War II. Topics include covert action, intelligence successes and failures, the changing motives and methods of traitors, congressional oversight, and ethical dilemmas. The course pays particular attention to how emerging technologies are transforming intelligence today. We examine cyber threats, the growing use of AI for both insight and deception, and the 'open-source' intelligence revolution online. Classes include guest lectures by former senior U.S. intelligence officials, policymakers, and open-source intelligence leaders. Course requirements include an all-day crisis simulation with former senior officials designed to give students a hands-on feel for the uncertainties, coordination challenges, time pressures, and policy frictions of intelligence in the American foreign policy process."
AMSTUD 117R:,"Christianity, Race, and Gender in 21st-century America (RELIGST 117)","As the largest religion practiced in the United States, Christianity not only shapes the private lives of a large number of Americans but also plays an important role in public discourse, policies, and debates. This course investigates Christianity's place on the shifting religious landscape in America, with special attention to present-day movements for racial and gender justice in the era of Black Lives Matter and #MeToo. Students explore reasons for declining numbers of Christians in the United States, the polarization of Christian conservatives and religious ""nones,"" and Christian constructions of social relations. How do Christian beliefs and practices shape attitudes about race and gender roles? How is contemporary Christianity acting as a force for as well as a barrier to social justice? This course assumes no background in the study of religion, race, or gender and is open to practitioners of all faiths or none."

This course looks at competing visions of what democracy should be and different notions of the role of dialogue in a democracy. Is it just campaigning or does it include deliberation? Small scale discussions or sound bites on television? Or social media? What is the role of technology in changing our democratic practices, to mobilize, to persuade, to solve public problems? This course will include readings from political theory about democratic ideals - from the American founders to J.S. Mill and the Progressives to Joseph Schumpeter and modern writers skeptical of the public will. It will also include contemporary examinations of the media and the internet to see how those practices are changing and how the ideals can or cannot be realized."

Often characterized as polar opposites - one advocating armed self-defense and the other non-violence against all provocation - they continue to be important religious, political, and intellectual models for how we imagine the past as well as for current issues concerning religion, race, politics and freedom struggles in the United States and globally. This course focuses on the political and spiritual lives of Martin and Malcolm. We will examine their personal biographies, speeches, writings, representations, FBI Files, and legacies as a way to better understand how the intersections of religion, race, and politics came to bare upon the freedom struggles of people of color in the US and abroad. The course also takes seriously the evolutions in both Martin and Malcolm's political approaches and intellectual development, focusing especially o more »"

An interface between technology and academia, with the the quirky influence of the counterculture in the background. A surprisingly agile cultural behemoth that has reshaped human relationships and hierarchies of all sorts. A brotopia built on the preferences and predilections of rich, geeky white guys. A location with perpetually sunny skies and easy access to beaches and mountains. nnThis seminar will unpack the myths surrounding Silicon Valley by exploring the people, places, industries, and ideas that have shaped it from post-WWII to the present. It takes an interdisciplinary approach to the subject and considers region's history and development; the products of Silicon Valley, from computers and circuit boards to search algorithms and social networks; and Silicon Valley's depictions in photography, film, television, and literature."
AMSTUD 157P:,"Solidarity and Racial Justice (AFRICAAM 157P, CSRE 157P, FEMGEN 157P)","Is multiracial solidarity necessary to overcome oppression that disproportionately affects certain communities of color? What is frontline leadership and what role should people play if they are not part of frontline communities? In this course we will critically examine practices of solidarity and allyship in movements for collective liberation. Through analysis of historical and contemporary movements, as well as participation in movement work, we will see how movements have built multiracial solidarity to address issues that are important to the liberation of all. We will also see how racial justice intersects with other identities and issues. This course is for students that want to learn how to practice solidarity, whether to be better allies or to work more effectively with allies. There will be a community engaged learning option for this course. Students who choose to participate in this option will either work with Stanford's DGen Office or a community organization that is explicitly devoted to multiracial movement-building."

This course examines his classic novels and essays as well his exciting work across many lesser-examined domains - poetry, music, theatre, sermon, photo-text, children's literature, public media, comedy and artistic collaboration. Placing his work in context with other writers of the 20C (Faulkner, Wright, Morrison) and capitalizing on a resurgence of interest in the writer (NYC just dedicated a year of celebration of Baldwin and there are 2 new journals dedicated to study of Baldwin), the course seeks to capture the power and influence of Baldwin's work during the Civil Rights era as well as his relevance in the ""post-race"" transnational 21st century, when his prescient questioning of the boundaries of race, sex, love, leadership and country assume new urgency."

ANTHRO 10SC:,Evolution and Conservation in Galápagos (HUMBIO 17SC),"The tiny remote islands of Galápagos have played a central role in the study of evolution. Not surprisingly, they have also been important to theory and practice in biodiversity conservation. The fascinating adaptations of organisms to the unusual, isolated ecosystems of the archipelago have left them particularly vulnerable to perturbations and introductions from the outside. Drawing on lessons learned from Darwin's time to the present, this seminar explores evolution, conservation, and their connection among the habitats and organisms of Galápagos. Using case-study material on tortoises, iguanas, finches, Scalesia plants, penguins, cormorants and more, we will explore current theory and debate about adaptation, speciation, adaptive radiation, sexual selection, and other topics in evolution. Similarly, we will explore the special challenges Galápagos poses today for conservation, owing to both its unusual biota and to the increasing impact of human activity in the archipelago.This cou more »"
ANTHRO 27N:,Ethnicity and Violence: Anthropological Perspectives,"Ethnicity is one of the most compelling and most modern ways in which people - in the midst of considerable global and local uncertainty - all across the world imagine and narrate themselves. This seminar will take an anthropological look at both the modernity and the compulsions of ethnic allegiance, and, why struggles over ethnic identity are so frequently violent. Our questions will be both historical; how, why and when did people come to think of themselves as possessing different ethnic identities - and contemporary; how are these identities lived, understood, narrated, and transformed and what is the consequence of such ethnicisation. We follow this through anthropological perspectives which ask persistently how people themselves locally narrate and act upon their experiences and histories. Through this we will approach some of the really big and yet everyday questions that many of us around the world face: how do we relate to ourselves and to those we define as others; and how d more »"
ANTHRO 34:,Animals and Us (ARCHLGY 34),"The human-animal relationship is dynamic, all encompassing and durable. Without exception, all socio-cultural groups have evidenced complex interactions with the animals around them, both domesticated and wild. However, the individual circumstances of these interactions are hugely complicated, and involve much more than direct human-animal contact, going far beyond this to incorporate social, ecological and spiritual contexts.This course delves into this complexity, covering the gamut of social roles played by animals, as well as the methods and approaches to studying these, both traditional and scientific. While the notion of `animals as social actors is well acknowledged, their use as proxies for human autecology (the relationship between a species and its environment) is also increasingly recognized as a viable mechanism for understanding our cultural and economic past. It will piece together the breadth of human-animal relationships using a wide geographic range of case studies."
ANTHRO 82P:,"The Literature of Psychosis (HUMBIO 162L, PSYC 82, PSYC 282)","One of the great gifts of literature is its ability to give us insight into the internal worlds of others. This is particularly true of that state clinicians call ""psychosis."" But psychosis is a complex concept. It can be terrifying and devastating for patients and families, and yet shares characteristics with other, less pathological states, such as mysticism and creativity. How then can we begin to make sense of it? In this course, we will examine the first-hand experience of psychosis. We will approach it from multiple perspectives, including clinical descriptions, works of art, and texts by writers ranging from Shakespeare, to the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, to patients attempting to describe their experience. This class is not only for students thinking of careers in medicine, psychology or anthropology, but also readers and writers interested exploring extraordinary texts. There are no prerequisites necessary; all that is needed is a love of language and a curiosity about the secrets of other minds."

ANTHRO 104D:,"Introduction to Race and Technology (CSRE 104, SYMSYS 104)","How do ideas about race get encoded in the design of new technology? How have science and technology shaped our understanding of race and identity? Drawing on research in anthropology, history, media studies, STS, and beyond, we will consider how technology can reinforce and amplify racial inequality. From the 'scientific' origins of the concept of race in the 18th century to contemporary algorithms that attempt to detect a person's race from their image, we will explore how social ideas about race are both embedded in and transformed by technology. We will also highlight how communities of color have resisted the encroachment of harmful technologies and developed alternatives that promote racial justice. Topics covered will include: algorithmic bias, policing and borders, surveillance, disinformation, data colonialism, and labor issues like micro-tasking and data annotation. This introductory course has no prerequisites and welcomes students of all disciplines."
ANTHRO 113:,"Culture and Epigenetics: Towards A Non-Darwinian Synthesis (ANTHRO 213, ARCHLGY 113)","The course examines the impact of new research in epigenetics on our understanding of long-term cultural change. The course examines the various attempts that have been made over recent decades to find a synthesis between cultural and biological evolution. These approaches, often termed neo-Darwinian, include memes, dual inheritance theory, theories of cultural selection and transmission, niche construction theory and macro-evolutionary approaches. Research in all these areas will be examined, with particular reference to explanations for the origins of agriculture, but also including other transformations, and critiqued. New research in epigenetics offers an alternative non-Darwinian evolutionary perspective that avoids many of the problems and pitfalls in the neo-Darwinian approaches. Cultural evolution comes to be viewed as cumulative, directional and Lamarckian, since heritable epigenetic variation can underlie evolutionary change. Epigenetics opens the way for human cultural entanglements to become the drivers for evolutionary change, thus allowing the full range of social processes studied in the social and cultural sciences to take their place in the study and analysis of long-term change."
ANTHRO 114:,"Rights and Ethics in Heritage (ANTHRO 214, ARCHLGY 114)","Heritage is a human thing: made by people and mobilized for their own purposes, it has a range of effects on communities. This course focuses on the human dimension of heritage with special attention to questions of rights and ethics. Where can we locate the intersections of heritage and rights? How do communities and governing structures negotiate control over and participation in heritage, and with what impacts on people? Which ethical challenges arise and how have archaeologists, heritage managers, museums, legislators, community leaders, and others approached these issues?The first half of this seminar course focuses on the theoretical and contextual basis for these discussions. We will address topics such as cultural ownership and participation as well as the global and governing contexts within which heritage is mobilized. Building on this, the second half examines cases in which different rights, needs, and goals come into conflict: museum practice, public memory, upheaval stemming from violence or disaster, and the ethics of the material world itself. Throughout, we will highlight heritage in relation to communities, rights, and responsibilities, all while thinking through ethical modes of heritage research and practice."

However, beyond this, they have played a range of social roles once an individual is deceased. The processes associated with excarnation, interment, exhumation and reburial all speak to the place that the body, and its parts, play in our cultural as well as physical landscape.This course builds on introductory courses in human skeletal anatomy by adding the social dynamics that govern the way humans treat other humans once they have died. It draws on anthropological, biological and archaeological research, with case studies spanning a broad chronological and spatial framework to provide students with an overview of social practice as it relates to the human body."
ANTHRO 117C:,"Global Heritage: Conflict, Reconciliation, and Diplomacy (ARCHLGY 105)","Archaeological studies from the 1990s framed cultural heritage as a resource that created attachments to place and to the past as a means to buttress national and cultural identities. But heritage can no longer be viewed as simply a marker of a singular, national identity. As a global era ushers in new regimes of heritage management, heritage becomes embroiled in a multitude of interactions whether acting as a fulcrum of transnational governance or functioning at the crux of community empowered utilizations and initiatives.nnThis course will trace what happens to heritage as it has been drawn into a world of global interactions while also maintaining more local forms of attachment. The class will address three themes (conflict, reconciliation, and diplomacy), all of which result from the multi-scalar relations that emerge from heritage financing, management, and preservation in a transnational arena.

Building off the definition of dress, pulled from Mary Ellen Roach-Higgins and Joanne B. Eicher, this course examines sartorial practices as social-cultural practices, shaped by many intersecting operations of power and oppression including racism, sexism, and classism, that involve modifications of the corporal form (i.e., scarification, body piercings, and hair alteration) as well as all three-dimensional supplements added to the body (i.e., clothing, hair combs, and jewelry). The emphasis on intersecting operations of power and oppression within this definition of dress draws on Kimbrel Crenshaw's conceptualization of intersectionality. Through case studies and examples from various parts of the world, we will explore multiple sources of data - documentary, material, and oral - that have come to shape the study of dress. We examine how dress intersects with facets of identity, including race, age, ethnicity, sexuality, and class."
ANTHRO 132A:,Power and Counter-Power: Anti-Elite Politics in Contemporary Times,"We live in politically turbulent times, and so much of the confounding social and political movements of our times seem to position themselves against 'the elite': feminist movements against patriarchal states, autonomists against neoliberal capitalism and the police, White nationalists, nativists and populist strongmen against 'liberals', etc. These expressions of social and political discontent stand oddly at their political opposites (Left v. Right), share common grievances around the lack of structural responses by the states and the international community towards climate change, neoliberalism, racism and the like. They also all use decentralized, global networks and mediascapes to make themselves present. This course looks at social formations that emerge at the absence, or in opposition to, state and elite control.

ANTHRO 184A:,Vital Curse: Oil As Culture,"Rapidly-evolving technology draws increasing amounts of petroleum from the ground, while wars and friendly agreements move it around the globe, all to occasionally-disastrous result. Pronounced environmental concerns such as fracking, pipelines, plastics, climate change are nearly synonymous with the petroleum industry. And yet, oil is integral to meeting basic human needs like food and water, and integral to meeting modern desires for mobility, energy, and consumer-products on demand. This class approaches the modern world¿s increasingly-reluctant reliance on oil¿from extraction to consumption with problems included¿as a complex cultural practice to be analyzed using anthropology, geography, and environmental studies."

This course will explore how virtually all the most consequential ideas emerging from now canonical thinkers - on human freedom and autonomy, reason, popular self-determination, property rights, civility, liberal toleration, equality, empirical social sciences and much else - arose as direct answers to the new epistemic, moral and political challenges of empire and colonial conquest. The world of empire indelibly shaped and created the intellectual legacy that informs modern social theory on a global scale - both its internal critiques, its liberal, and emancipatory potentials, as well as its many illiberal, racist and exclusionary strands and more »"
ANTHRO 303X:,"Memory, Materiality, and Archaeology (ARCHLGY 303)","This seminar will explore several themes related to memory and material culture - broadly conceived to include art, architecture, the built environment, and landscapes, through archaeological, historical, and ethnographic lenses. How can we understand the role of socially resonant individual and collective memories through materiality in the past? What is the materiality of memorialization and commemoration, and are they affected by political contestation and power? Additionally, how does material culture through anthropological interpretation aid or transform social memory in the present?This seminar does not attempt to be all-inclusive of the themes and topics generated by intersection of memory and materiality. Rather, the seminar is designed around an introduction to how humanists and social scientists (including sociocultural anthropologists and archaeologists) have approached social and collective memory, and seven specific theoretical or threads for which archaeologists offer un more »"
ANTHRO 356A:,The Universal and the Vernacular. The Global Life of Concepts and Social Forms,"Mapping and understanding vernacular concepts and terminologies has always been central to the anthropological quest to understand societies from `a native point of view'. This has often been accompanied by a critique of universalist and Euro-centric assumptions in the social sciences and in social theory. As a result, the convention has become to treat the `universal¿ (ideas, frames, institutions) as external, often imposed by colonial powers, while the `vernacular¿ conventionally is seen as local and authentic, and the proper site of anthropology.nThis course seeks to rethink this spatial and historical distinction between the universal and the vernacular. Instead we ask: how, and when, do concepts, or practices, become embedded in a vernacular world? Reversely, instead of assuming that universals all originate in Euro-America, we ask: how do concepts and practices become both global and universal? We will trace how impactful ideologies, social forms and institutions have travelled i more »"
ANTHRO 363:,Queer Anthropology,"Feminist and queer theory have profoundly rethought epistemologies as well as methodologies. This graduate seminar will explore the relationship between feminist and queer theory and the new directions proposed by queer anthropology in socio-cultural anthropology and archaeology. In addition, the seminar will discuss the challenges that looking at queer studies from anthropology and archaeology can bring from questions of race, global inequalities, misrecognitions as well as specific historical and cultural genealogies which offer more than simply adding diversity to questions already raised within queer studies. Students will acquire both conceptual and methodological skills. nThis year-long graduate seminar adopts a workshop-like format over the entire 2018-2019 academic year. We will meet for eleven (three hour) meetings over three quarters (4 meetings in Autumn, 3 meetings in Winter, and 4 meetings in Spring. Students are required to enroll in all three quarters. Pre-requisite: instructor consent."
ANTHRO 402D:,"Materialities of Power, Part I (HISTORY 403A)","How is power made material? And how do material things--objects, commodities, technologies, and infrastructures --reflect, change, consolidate, or distribute power? This research seminar is aimed at PhD students in history, anthropology, and STS who are working on such questions. All geographic specialties welcome. A small amount of common reading will launch the course, whose main goal is to guide students towards producing a research paper draft that's close to submission-ready for a journal. Along the way, we'll also address practical topics, including how to pick and submit to a journal, how to present a paper, and more."

APPPHYS 13N:,A Taste of Quantum Physics (PHYSICS 13N),"What is quantum physics and what makes it so weird? We'll introduce key aspects of quantum physics with an aim to discover why it differs from everyday 'classical' physics. Students will explore how devices like the laser and atomic clocks for GPS are enabled by quantum physics. We will also discuss the breakthroughs driving the 2nd quantum technology revolution surrounding quantum simulators, sensors, and computers. Seminar discussions and a laser lab will help illustrate core principles, including the atomic clock mechanism. Visits to campus laboratories will introduce cutting-edge quantum experiments. Assignments include text readings and midterm and final projects.While basic familiarity with high school physics is recommended, this IntroSem is friendly to students of all majors who might be interested in these topics; qualitative explanations will be emphasized. By the end of the quarter, you will be able to explain the key tenets of quantum physics, how it has enabled current technology, and what new technologies might emerge from the 2nd quantum revolution."
ARCHLGY 34:,Animals and Us (ANTHRO 34),"The human-animal relationship is dynamic, all encompassing and durable. Without exception, all socio-cultural groups have evidenced complex interactions with the animals around them, both domesticated and wild. However, the individual circumstances of these interactions are hugely complicated, and involve much more than direct human-animal contact, going far beyond this to incorporate social, ecological and spiritual contexts.This course delves into this complexity, covering the gamut of social roles played by animals, as well as the methods and approaches to studying these, both traditional and scientific. While the notion of `animals as social actors is well acknowledged, their use as proxies for human autecology (the relationship between a species and its environment) is also increasingly recognized as a viable mechanism for understanding our cultural and economic past. It will piece together the breadth of human-animal relationships using a wide geographic range of case studies."
ARCHLGY 86:,Digital Methods for Archaeology and Anthropology,"Digital tools can be a powerful way of collecting, analyzing and presenting data in social-cultural anthropology and archaeology. This survey course is designed for students from all backgrounds interested in developing practical skills in computational methods, no previous computational experience is required. Over the span of four 2.5 week units, we will develop foundational skills for 1) text processing, 2) geospatial analysis (e.g GIS), 3) bioinformatics and paleogenetics, and 4) data visualization. Each unit will take a deep dive into the way these approaches have been used in anthropology in published case studies. This will be complemented by digital lab activities (suitable for remote or in-person learning) to develop skills and complete an independent project of your choosing with the tools learned in this course. The goal is to set you up with digital tools that are useful to you in academic, journalistic, and other related endeavors."
ARCHLGY 104:,Digital Methods in Archaeology,Archaeologists have long adapted and incorporated available digital tools into their methodological toolkits. The recent explosion in computing power and availability has led to a proliferation of digital apparatus in archaeology and sparked dynamic theoretical and methodological discussions within the discipline. This course provides an overview of digital tools and methods utilized by archaeologists through all stages of research.
ARCHLGY 105:,"Global Heritage: Conflict, Reconciliation, and Diplomacy (ANTHRO 117C)","Archaeological studies from the 1990s framed cultural heritage as a resource that created attachments to place and to the past as a means to buttress national and cultural identities. But heritage can no longer be viewed as simply a marker of a singular, national identity. As a global era ushers in new regimes of heritage management, heritage becomes embroiled in a multitude of interactions whether acting as a fulcrum of transnational governance or functioning at the crux of community empowered utilizations and initiatives.nnThis course will trace what happens to heritage as it has been drawn into a world of global interactions while also maintaining more local forms of attachment. The class will address three themes (conflict, reconciliation, and diplomacy), all of which result from the multi-scalar relations that emerge from heritage financing, management, and preservation in a transnational arena. While the class will discuss cases that include both tangible and intangible heritage, more »"
ARCHLGY 108:,Ancient DNA and the Human Past,"The rapidly growing field of paleogenomics has brought together researchers from a wide variety of fields and perspectives in the social and natural sciences. This survey course is designed for students from all backgrounds interested in developing practical skills in ancient DNA methods, contextual research, analysis and interpretation. We will also focus on exploring and discussing ethics in the field and the implications of the growing interest of public audiences with ancient DNA (such as the 23andMe direct-to-consumer genetic test for Neanderthal ancestry). Throughout the course, we will also explore a variety of related topics by taking a deep dive into the archaeology context and analytical approaches of published case studies. For a final project, you will explore a site, topic or study of your choosing with the tools learned in this course and evaluate the potential for ancient DNA to uncover new findings there."
ARCHLGY 113:,"Culture and Epigenetics: Towards A Non-Darwinian Synthesis (ANTHRO 113, ANTHRO 213)","The course examines the impact of new research in epigenetics on our understanding of long-term cultural change. The course examines the various attempts that have been made over recent decades to find a synthesis between cultural and biological evolution. These approaches, often termed neo-Darwinian, include memes, dual inheritance theory, theories of cultural selection and transmission, niche construction theory and macro-evolutionary approaches. Research in all these areas will be examined, with particular reference to explanations for the origins of agriculture, but also including other transformations, and critiqued. New research in epigenetics offers an alternative non-Darwinian evolutionary perspective that avoids many of the problems and pitfalls in the neo-Darwinian approaches. Cultural evolution comes to be viewed as cumulative, directional and Lamarckian, since heritable epigenetic variation can underlie evolutionary change. Epigenetics opens the way for human cultural entanglements to become the drivers for evolutionary change, thus allowing the full range of social processes studied in the social and cultural sciences to take their place in the study and analysis of long-term change."
ARCHLGY 114:,"Rights and Ethics in Heritage (ANTHRO 114, ANTHRO 214)","Heritage is a human thing: made by people and mobilized for their own purposes, it has a range of effects on communities. This course focuses on the human dimension of heritage with special attention to questions of rights and ethics. Where can we locate the intersections of heritage and rights? How do communities and governing structures negotiate control over and participation in heritage, and with what impacts on people? Which ethical challenges arise and how have archaeologists, heritage managers, museums, legislators, community leaders, and others approached these issues?The first half of this seminar course focuses on the theoretical and contextual basis for these discussions. We will address topics such as cultural ownership and participation as well as the global and governing contexts within which heritage is mobilized. Building on this, the second half examines cases in which different rights, needs, and goals come into conflict: museum practice, public memory, upheaval stemming from violence or disaster, and the ethics of the material world itself. Throughout, we will highlight heritage in relation to communities, rights, and responsibilities, all while thinking through ethical modes of heritage research and practice."
ARCHLGY 115:,"The Social life of Human Bones (ANTHRO 115, ANTHRO 215)","Skeletal remains serve a primary function of support and protection for the human body. However, beyond this, they have played a range of social roles once an individual is deceased. The processes associated with excarnation, interment, exhumation and reburial all speak to the place that the body, and its parts, play in our cultural as well as physical landscape.This course builds on introductory courses in human skeletal anatomy by adding the social dynamics that govern the way humans treat other humans once they have died. It draws on anthropological, biological and archaeological research, with case studies spanning a broad chronological and spatial framework to provide students with an overview of social practice as it relates to the human body."
ARCHLGY 117:,"Virtual Italy (CLASSICS 115, ENGLISH 115, HISTORY 238C, ITALIAN 115)","Classical Italy attracted thousands of travelers throughout the 1700s. Referring to their journey as the ""Grand Tour,"" travelers pursued intellectual passions, promoted careers, and satisfied wanderlust, all while collecting antiquities to fill museums and estates back home. What can computational approaches tell us about who traveled, where and why? We will read travel accounts; experiment with parsing; and visualize historical data.

ARCHLGY 221B:,"""The Will to Adorn"": An Anthropology of Dress (AFRICAAM 121B, ANTHRO 121B, ANTHRO 221B)","This seminar explores sartorial practices as a means for examining formations of identities and structural inequalities across space and time. Building off the definition of dress, pulled from Mary Ellen Roach-Higgins and Joanne B. Eicher, this course examines sartorial practices as social-cultural practices, shaped by many intersecting operations of power and oppression including racism, sexism, and classism, that involve modifications of the corporal form (i.e., scarification, body piercings, and hair alteration) as well as all three-dimensional supplements added to the body (i.e., clothing, hair combs, and jewelry). The emphasis on intersecting operations of power and oppression within this definition of dress draws on Kimbrel Crenshaw's conceptualization of intersectionality. Through case studies and examples from various parts of the world, we will explore multiple sources of data - documentary, material, and oral - that have come to shape the study of dress. We examine how dress intersects with facets of identity, including race, age, ethnicity, sexuality, and class."

ARTHIST 100N:,The Artist in Ancient Greek Society (CLASSICS 18N),"Given the importance of art to all aspects of their lives, the Greeks had reason to respect their artists. Yet potters, painters and even sculptors possessed little social standing. Why did the Greeks value the work of craftsmen but not the men themselves? Why did Herodotus dismiss those who worked with their hands as ""mechanics?"" What prompted Homer to claim that ""there is no greater glory for a man than what he achieves with his own hands,"" provided that he was throwing a discus and not a vase on a wheel? Painted pottery was essential to the religious and secular lives of the Greeks. Libations to the gods and to the dead required vessels from which to pour them. Economic prosperity depended on the export of wine and oil in durable clay containers. At home, depictions of gods and heroes on vases reinforced Greek values and helped parents to educate their children. Vases depicting Dionysian excess were produced for elite symposia, from which those who potted and painted them were exclu more »"

Why do we believe that love is above all a visual force? How is pleasure, even erotic pleasure, achieved through looking? While the psychology of impressions offers some answers, this course uncovers the ways poets, songwriters, and especially artists have explored myths and promoted ideas about the coupling of love and seeing. Week by week, we will be reflecting on love as political critique, social disruption, and magical force. And we will do so by examining some of the most iconic works of art, from Dante's writings on lovesickness to Caravaggio's Narcissus, studying the ways that objects have shifted from keepsakes to targets of our cares. While exploring the visual roots and evolutions of what has become one of life's fundamental drives, this course offers a passionate survey of European art from Giotto's kiss to Fragonard's swing that elicits stimulating questions about the sensorial nature of desire and the human struggle to control emotions."

This is a discussion-heavy course, so come prepared to read, write and talk."
ARTHIST 165:,Vincent van Gogh and His World,"No artist is more famous than Vincent van Gogh. Yet how well is he known? Perhaps not at all. A victim of cliches and platitudes, his art is rarely seen, or, to put it differently, the power of its call on us is mostly unheeded. What was he searching for and what did he hope to make possible for us to experience along with him? How, to put it differently, did he love us? An adventure beyond the trite and true, an exploration in the powers of naivete, offered by someone without authority, the class will take us deeply into Van Gogh's art and his moment."

ARTHIST 206:,The Alchemy of Art: Substance and Transformation in Artistic Practice (ARTHIST 406),"This seminar considers materiality and processes of material transformation as core elements of artistic practice and the history of making, largely from Sumer (3rd Millennium BCE) until the Early Modern period (18th Century in the West), but with several modern comparisons. Major points of focus will include pre-modern perceptions of the elemental properties of materials as matter, the reflexive relationship between materials and imagination, and the diverse ways in which societies have associated specific substances with social and cultural values. Humanistic perspectives on such issues are augmented by complementary insights from the physical sciences, and references are made to current ideas regarding material agency, affordances, and the imperfect separability of nature and culture. Indeed, a central question underlying all the readings is how to distinguish natural from synthetic: where does nature end and art begin, or maybe where does nature stop?"

As the Arabs established the Umayyad caliphate in the seventh century, quickly conquering Holy Land, Egypt, and advancing all the way to Spain, they perpetrated an identity crisis in the region. By the seventh century three large political entities formed in the Mediterranean ¿ the Umayyads, the Carolingians, and the Byzantines ¿ each competed for legitimacy; all three emerged from the ashes of Late Antique culture, yet each tried to carve out an identity out of this common foundation. In this parting of the ways, the three cultures took among others the issue of what constituted an image and what role it played in devotion. Eik¿n, imago, ¿ura became the basis on which to built differences and accuse the other political players of idolatry."

We will read the body in audiovisual culture through an engagement with affect theory, focusing on the labor of performance, the construction of stardom, spatial and temporal configurations of the performing body, and the production of affect and sensation in the spectating body. Through a discussion of make-up, fashion, the labor of producing the idealized star body from the meat-and-bones body of the actor, or body genres where the spectator's body is beside itself with sexual pleasure, fear and terror, or overpowering sadness, we will inquire into ideologies of discipline and desire that undergird mediatized bodies more »"

In this course, students gain confidence and experience connecting to their artistic voices as we explore the myriad possible career paths artists take to build sustainable careers. The course consists of a series of studio projects, each centered around a different artist whose career and art practice we study. The example artists will be primarily artists of color, or artists from communities which are underrepresented in the art world, with practices and careers ranging from the conventional to the more unusual. The goal of these artist selections is to model the possibilities of an art career for students who do not easily see themselves well represented in the mainstream art world, while also broadening all students¿ understanding of the many different methods for making work and practicing as an artist today."
ARTSTUDI 141A:,Drawing from Life (ARTSTUDI 241A),"The subject of this course is Life as we know it, and artists at all levels will learn to communicate their questions, concerns, and perspectives on paper. The drawing process empowers students to express themselves in their already unique visual languages, while the objects will be testimonies to their personal, cultural, spiritual, and revolutionary experiences. We begin by developing or refining students' fundamental techniques through indoor and outdoor observational drawing. Our focus shifts toward representational and conceptual strategies for storytelling that reference students¿ archives, popularized content, literature, historical references and more. Through drawing, we discuss and examine a diverse range of contemporary art to address the legacy of visual art.

ARTSTUDI 171M:,The Photography Zine,"The course combines the critical analysis and creation of photography and photo zines that explore this specific medium's experimental, social and documentary potential. A zine is a DIY small-circulation, self-published print work of original or appropriated texts and images, usually produced in small, limited quantities. Discussions, projects, and readings focus on the photography zine for the preservation of minority and marginalized interests. This course familiarizeS students with analog DIY techniques for using original and appropriated photography. Students are asked to consider how their voices can be expressed through introspection, engagement with personal history, cultural subjectivities, and activism. Students are introduced to artists who make zines and why this structure is vital to their practice and community-building efforts. Emphasis is placed on actions of presence, joy, experimentation, and intention rather than perfection. All experience levels are welcome. We visit the SFMOMA and the zine collections from the San Francisco Library and view collections from the Marjorie Barrick Museum of Art in Las Vegas, NV. Additionally, we collaborate with and attend a workshop with the Italic program at Stanford."
ARTSTUDI 201:,Art Practice Major Seminar,"In this WIM course, students develop writing skills specific to the Art Practice discipline, including Artists Statements, Research Statements, and Grant Proposals, which are required of all professional artists.

As we stare down statistics that depict whole industries, political bodies, and rooms of-influence as dominated by primarily cis-gendered white men, we choose not to lose faith, but dare to ask, 'how would our world look, feel, and function if it were built by women?' This course is meant not as an historical survey of the objective accomplishments of female architects but as a future-facing call-to-action to envision a world built by women and gender-expansive people. What might our built environments look and feel like with bold, creative women at the helm? How might we celebrate and honor more diverse and brilliant perspectives in architecture across a broad gender spectrum? How might we demand greater space for women in architecture to lead an industry into its next era? And how might we support a rising generation of young women poised to build the world they want to see? Combining topical discussions, case studies, personal reflections, charrette exercises, and a culminating design/build experience at Girls Garage, this course will inspire students of all genders to draw from the lessons of women in architecture and imagine a built environment that represents us all."

CHINA 20:,"Humanities Core: Dao, Virtue, and Nature -- Foundations of East Asian Thought (HUMCORE 20, JAPAN 20, KOREA 20)","This course explores the values and questions posed in the formative period of East Asian civilizations. Notions of a Dao (""Way"") are common to Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism, but those systems of thought have radically different ideas about what that Dao is and how it might be realized in society and an individual's life. These systems of thought appeared first in China, and eventually spread to Korea and Japan. Each culture developed its own ways of reconciling the competing systems, but in each case the comprehensive structure of values and human ideals differs significantly from those that appeared elsewhere in the ancient world. The course examines East Asian ideas about self-cultivation, harmonious society, rulership, and the relation between human and nature with a view toward expanding our understanding of these issues in human history, and highlighting their legacies in Asian civilizations today.

CHINA 21Q:,"Humanities Core: Love and Betrayal in Asia (HUMCORE 21Q, JAPAN 21Q, KOREA 21Q)","Why are lovers in storybooks East and West always star-crossed? Why do love and death seem to go together? For every Romeo and Juliet, there are dozens of doomed lovers in the Asian literary repertoires, from Genji's string of embittered mistresses, to the Butterfly lovers in early modern China, to the voices of desire in Koryo love songs, to the devoted adolescent cousins in Dream of the Red Chamber, to the media stars of Korean romantic drama, now wildly popular throughout Asia. In this course, we explore how the love story has evolved over centuries of East Asian history, asking along the way what we can learn about Chinese, Japanese, and Korean views of family and community, gender and sexuality, truth and deception, trust and betrayal, ritual and emotion, and freedom and solidarity from canonical and non-canonical works in East Asian literatures.

CHINA 24:,"Humanities Core: How to be Modern in East Asia (COMPLIT 44, HUMCORE 133, JAPAN 24, KOREA 24)","Modern East Asia was almost continuously convulsed by war and revolution in the 19th and 20th centuries. But the everyday experience of modernity was structured more profoundly by the widening gulf between the country and the city, economically, politically, and culturally. This course examines literary and cinematic works from China and Japan that respond to and reflect on the city/country divide, framing it against issues of class, gender, national identity, and ethnicity. It also explores changing ideas about home/hometown, native soil, the folk, roots, migration, enlightenment, civilization, progress, modernization, nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and sustainability. All materials are in English. This course is part of the Humanities Core: https://humanitiescore.stanford.edu/"
CHINA 70N:,Animal Planet and the Romance of the Species (COMPLIT 70N),"Preference to freshmen.This course considers a variety of animal characters in Chinese and Western literatures as potent symbols of cultural values and dynamic sites of ethical reasoning. What does pervasive animal imagery tell us about how we relate to the world and our neighbors? How do animals define the frontiers of humanity and mediate notions of civilization and culture? How do culture, institutions, and political economy shape concepts of human rights and animal welfare? And, above all, what does it mean to be human in the pluralistic and planetary 21st century?

CHINA 163A:,Looking for the Way (Dao) in East Asia (HUMCORE 113),"This course looks at foundations of East Asian thought, including Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism as well as other cultural traditions. The ideologies were first articulated in ancient China (or India) and from there spread to Korea, Japan, and throughout Southeast Asia, where they remain important today. We will read selections from seminal texts including ""The Confucian Analects"", ""Daode jing"", ""Zhuangzi"", and ""The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch"". Attention is also given to other perennial (and often problematic) themes of Asian life and society, including those of conflicting loyalties and violent revenge. Finally, the course examines aesthetic expression in painting and calligraphy that became the embodiment of classical philosophical values and their own articulation of an aestheticized Way, still widely practiced and admired.

What did black skin color indicate in the centuries before the Trans-Atlantic slave trade? In this course, students will investigate the history of black skin color in Greek and Roman antiquity alongside the legacy of race within the field of Classics (ancient Greek and Latin literature). In addition to interrogating the terms 'race' and 'blackness' as it applies to an ancient time period, students will cross-examine the role that race and cultural imperialism have played in the formation of the current discipline of Classics. This course will benefit greatly from students with a broad spectrum of interests; all are welcome to join the discussion."
CLASSICS 17SC:,Classical California,"If you counted the many modern guises in which ancient Greece and Rome show up in our lives, how many could you find? You might consider, for example, words we speak, films we watch, buildings we use, political concepts we debate, styles we admire, myths we read. This course is our chance to explore such rich diversity, emphasizing the more material kinds of `classical remembrance. Our focus will be on California, its architecture, its collections of ancient objects. Readings, to be discussed in class, will inform our treasure hunt, which will start with Stanford University collections and proceed farther afield. Pandemic permitting, we'll visit the Getty Villa in Malibu, one of the world's foremost collections of ancient art housed in the imposing reconstruction of an ancient Roman villa.

CLASSICS 18N:,The Artist in Ancient Greek Society (ARTHIST 100N),"Given the importance of art to all aspects of their lives, the Greeks had reason to respect their artists. Yet potters, painters and even sculptors possessed little social standing. Why did the Greeks value the work of craftsmen but not the men themselves? Why did Herodotus dismiss those who worked with their hands as ""mechanics?"" What prompted Homer to claim that ""there is no greater glory for a man than what he achieves with his own hands,"" provided that he was throwing a discus and not a vase on a wheel? Painted pottery was essential to the religious and secular lives of the Greeks. Libations to the gods and to the dead required vessels from which to pour them. Economic prosperity depended on the export of wine and oil in durable clay containers. At home, depictions of gods and heroes on vases reinforced Greek values and helped parents to educate their children. Vases depicting Dionysian excess were produced for elite symposia, from which those who potted and painted them were exclu more »"
CLASSICS 29N:,Ancient Myth in Modern Poetry,"For millennia, the myths of ancient Greece and Rome have been objects of fascination and tools for exploring humanity's most abiding concerns: self, society, birth, death and the afterlife, the cosmos and the divine. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the power and beauty of these archaic narratives have inspired scores of poets, including such well-known figures as Yeats, Heaney, Eliot, Pound, H.D., Seferis, Rilke, Auden, Mandelshtam and Tsvetaeva. We will delve into this rich poetic heritage, savoring the full range of modern responses, while paying attention to the many meanings of the old stories that they echo or challenge.

CLASSICS 88:,Origins of History in Greece and Rome (HISTORY 114),"What's the history of `History'? The first ancient historians wrote about commoners and kings, conquest and power - those who had it, those who wanted it, those without it. Their powerful ways of recounting the past still resonate today and can be harnessed to tell new stories. We will look at how ancients like Herodotus, Thucydides, Tacitus, and Livy turned stories about the past into compelling narratives of loss, growth and decline - inventing 'History' as we know it. All readings in English."
CLASSICS 101L:,Advanced Latin: Communication is Key. Cicero's De oratore,"Why should we care about (the art of) speaking well? How do we perfect it, and towards what ideal? These are the questions Marcus Tullius Cicero explores in his rhetorical and philosophical masterpiece of 55BC. A fictional dialogue of historical characters, including the greatest speakers of Cicero's adolescence, Marcus Antonius and Lucius L. Crassus, it is set in 91 before a darkening background of civil unrest (and worse). Evoking Plato's Phaedrus, anticipating his own situation in the 50s, Cicero weaves together a beautiful discussion of what we should all care about. We'll read De oratore in selection, a few letters and excerpts from his other works, along with chapters from Fantham's The Roman World and Rawson's intellectual biography.

Following that, we learn how to read Euclid from manuscript and, following that, we proceed to read the Archimedes palimpsest itself. Course requires one year of Greek."
CLASSICS 192:,Latin (and Its Speakers) in Time and Space (CLASSICS 292),"What do we mean by ""Latin""?

We also have an astonishing range of Latin texts by people of every background: women, the enslaved, soldiers, merchants, travelers, non-native Latin users, even idle passerby. These documents range from single words to expansive treatises, simple greetings to complex rites; all inform the ""story of Latin"" as much as the elite ""literary"" writing of the Classical period, and are crucial evidence of life during Roman times. This course will introduce students (graduates and advanced undergraduates) to the study of Latin across time and context, with two major goals: 1) to make this sometimes overwhelming topic accessible; and 2) to better understand the rich cultural influences that shaped Latin in use.

COLLEGE 101:,Why College? Your Education and the Good Life,"You're about to embark on an amazing journey: a college education. But what is the purpose of this journey? Why go to college? Some argue that the purpose of college is to train you for a career. Others claim that college is no longer necessary, that you can launch the next big startup and change the world without a degree. Peter Thiel offers students like you $100,000 to skip or stop out of college because knowledge that is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind. Why read Plato if you're a STEM major, after all? Why think about primate health if you're in the arts? In the face of such critiques, this class makes a case for an expansive education that trains your mind to engage with a variety of subjects and skills. The philosophy behind this model has traditionally been called liberal education (from the Latin word for freedom, libertas). Together we will explore the history, practice, and rationales for a liberal education by putting canonical texts in conversation wit more »"
COLLEGE 103:,Globally Queer,"The progress of LGBTQ+ rights over the last half century has been remarkably swift and absolutely global. Pride parades and marriage rights have become emblems of a global movement that seems to transcend culture. This course asks what has allowed LGBTQ+ issues to become leading indicators of a certain kind of liberalization and modernization. What is the road LGBTQ+ rights took from the Stonewall Inn in 1969 to Pride Parades in Minsk, Kolkata and Nuuk, Greenland by 2015? This course will introduce students to the concepts and issues that have shaped this development. But it will also highlight the concepts by which historians, social scientists and political theorists have interrogated the problematic underbelly of this story of global triumph. What gets left out when we frame the course of LGBTQ+ history as somehow moving from Lower Manhattan to the rest of the world? Many academics studying LGBTQ+ history worry about the eurocentrism inherent in this way of telling the story this wa more »"
COLLEGE 107:,Preventing Human Extinction,"99.9% of all species that have ever inhabited Earth are now extinct, including 12 species of the genus Homo. The threat of human extinction is global, and it is driven by social, economic, technological and political forces operating at global scales. This course will explore several plausible scenarios by which human extinction (or near-extinction) could occur within the next 100 years. In this course, we will study the psychological, social, political, economic and epistemological barriers that frequently derail efforts to avert these catastrophes. We will explore diverse approaches to understanding these risks, strategies that could reduce them, and better ways to think and act as we move into an uncertain future. Students will engage these issues through academic reading, apocalyptic fiction, group discussion and writing. We will consider the role of human agency in the evolution of these risks and their prevention, and our responsibilities as 21st-century citizens."
COLLEGE 112:,Living with Viruses,"By examining the interplay of viruses and culture, this course challenges students to think beyond conventional disciplinary distinctions through questions about the impact of viruses on our world. While we are currently living through a pandemics and thus all realize the impact it has on our lives, this course breaks apart our lived experiences: including our need to blame certain populations, the disparities in healthcare, the use of immunity as a socioeconomic tool, and the evaluation of our own genetic makeup and its dependency on a billion years of viral integrations. The specific goals of this course are to engage students to examine the microbial world and how they interact with it. We will examine three overarching questions: How do viruses affect cultures and populations? How do we confront emerging conflicts, social disparities, and blame that accompany pandemics and How can we use stories and narratives to educate?"
COMM 1:,Introduction to Communication,"Our world is being transformed by media technologies that change how we interact with one another and perceived the world around us. These changes are all rooted in communication practices, and their consequences touch on almost all aspects of life. In COMM 1 we will examine the effects of media technologies on psychological life, on industry, and on communities local and global through theorizing and demonstrations and critiques of a wide range of communication products and services."
COMM 11SC:,Deliberative Democracy in Theory and Practice: Deliberating the Issues that Divide Us and Beyond,"American democracy is increasingly polarized and dysfunctional. Levels of public trust in the Congress and politicians are at virtually all-time lows, and so is the ability of members of different parties to work together in Washington, D.C., and in many state capitols, to find solutions to our major public policy problems. Much is written about the growing polarization of American society, yet public opinion polling suggests that the public is not as bitterly divided as the political class.
nOne perspective on the current crisis stresses the lack of opportunities for the American public to deliberate on key issues and challenges under good conditions - where they can receive balanced and informed briefings and talk with one another face to face, away from the glare of broadcast media and social networks that only reinforce their initial points of view. 'Good' conditions also provide trained moderators to encourage and ensure mutual respect for divergent points of view. When a represe more »"

COMM 111S:,Digital Media and Social Networks,"Our social interactions and relationships are important. Who we communicate with, how we communicate, and the quantity and quality of our social relationships all have an impact on our psychological well-being. Today, many of our interactions and relationships play out online in digital media, like social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, TikTok) and smartphones. In this course, we will explore (1) how communication behavior and social networks shape our lives online and offline, (2) the influence of personality and well-being on social life, and (3) social network approaches to studying interactions and relationships. By combining theory and research from communication and media psychology with social network analysis, we can understand how media platforms impact our psychological experiences and social environments. With communication technology playing an ever-increasing role in society, understanding how social interactions and relationships impact our lives has never been more critical."

You have taken the required first year courses, you hope you have explored enough, you are anxious about choosing a major. You know the campus fairly well, you have perhaps made some friends, you have some sort of routine. But you have the nagging feeling that so much of this is simply an illusion. The question then becomes, do you throw your faith, mind, and your body into that illusion (everyone else seems to), or do you risk the chance of missing a step by spending some time in Sophomore College reflecting on the immediate past and the future, with others who have similar questions. You may feel that the generalizations you heard in Year 1 about liberal education seem remote from your life experiences; you may have wished you could have engaged in more in-depth discussions, but that there was not time or interest in approaching the subject matter as you would have wanted to.

COMPLIT 43:,Modernity and Novels in the Middle East (HUMCORE 131),"This course will investigate cultural and literary responses to modernity in the Middle East. The intense modernization process that started in mid 19th century and lingers to this day in the region caused Arabic, Persian, and Turkish literary cultures to encounter rapid changes; borders dissolved, new societies and nations were formed, daily life westernized, and new literary forms took over the former models. In order to understand how writers and individuals negotiated between tradition and modernity and how they adapted their traditions into the modern life we will read both canonical and graphic novels comparatively from each language group and focus on the themes of nation, identity, and gender. All readings will be in English translation. This course is part of the Humanities Core: https://humanitiescore.stanford.edu/"

But the everyday experience of modernity was structured more profoundly by the widening gulf between the country and the city, economically, politically, and culturally. This course examines literary and cinematic works from China and Japan that respond to and reflect on the city/country divide, framing it against issues of class, gender, national identity, and ethnicity. It also explores changing ideas about home/hometown, native soil, the folk, roots, migration, enlightenment, civilization, progress, modernization, nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and sustainability.

The seminar's primary goal is to help participants understand the creation of better imaginary worlds - ultimately all our efforts should serve that higher purpose. Some of the things we will consider when taking on the analysis of a new world include: What are its primary features - spatial, cultural, biological, fantastic, cosmological? What is the world's ethos (the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize the world)? What are the precise strategies that are used by the artist to convey the world to us and us to the world? How are our characters connected to the world? And how are we - the viewer or reader or player - connected to the world?

COMPLIT 102:,Film Series: Understanding Turkey Through Film (COMPLIT 302),"Join us in our quest to understand the great transformation in Turkey and its impact on its people through cinema. Set against the backdrop of the expansion of capitalism and the fundamental cultural, political and social change in the last decade, the movies in this series tell the uneasy stories of individuals whose lives are affected by this disruptive change. By examining the link between the individual experiences and societal change, the films confront issues such as globalization, gender and racial hierarchies, urban transformation, state repression, male domination, and the women's struggle in Turkey. We will watch eight Turkish films for this course. After introductions by Dr. Alemdaroglu or Dr. Karahan that artistically, historically, and politically contextualize the films we will have a discussion and Q&A session led by instructors or invited guest scholars of Anthropology, Film Studies, Political Science, Women and Gender Studies or film directors themselves. The students and interested Stanford community will be provided with the streaming links for the movies at the beginning of each week to screen them on their own time, and the discussion sessions will be held on the scheduled class time on Thursday. All films will be in Turkish with English subtitles."
COMPLIT 104:,"Reading In Depth: Deep Time in Theory, Literature and Visual Art",What can the humanities teach us about deep time? Can human beings even conceive of the vast and unfathomable timescales presupposed by geology? The challenge that deep time poses to the human imagination - a challenge that has grown all the more urgent to address in light of our current environmental crisis - will be approached in this course 1. By considering how artists and writers create their own scales of measure in relation to deep time 2. By taking seriously claims of non-human animism in diverse cultural traditions 3. By examining how rhythms of human and non-human life are inscribed in specific literary and artistic works. Assignments in this seminar/arts practicum course will be creative and multimedia in kind. The course includes field trips to the Redwood forest and to the Hopkins Marine Station.
COMPLIT 107:,Why is Climate Change Un-believable? Interdisciplinary Approaches to Environmental Action,"The science is there. The evidence is there. Why do people still refuse to recognize one of the greatest threats to human existence? Why can't, why won't they believe the truth? The time to act is slowly evaporating before our eyes. To answer this question requires an interdisciplinary approach that investigates many of the ways global warming has been analyzed, imagined, represented, and evaluated. Thus we welcome students of any major willing to embark on this common project and to participate fully. We will challenge ourselves to move between and amongst texts that are familiar and those we will bring into the conversation. There will be much that we miss, but we hope this course will at least begin a serious conversation in a unique way. The course will run on two parallel tracks: on the one hand, we will delve into textual representations and arguments; on the other hand, we will attempt to develop a sensibility for how climate change makes itself manifest in the physical world th more »"

We will read his short stories and the novels ""The Luzhin Defense, Invitation to a Beheading, Lolita, Lolita"" the film, and ""Pale Fire"", to see how Nabokov generated his sinister-playful forms as a buoyant answer to the ""hypermodern"" visual and film culture of pre-WWII Berlin, and then to America's all-pervading postwar ""normalcy"" in his pathological comic masterpieces ""Lolita"" and ""Pale Fire"".

In this course, we will survey major critical approaches to literature from the last century as well as emerging methods from the digital humanities, and try them out for ourselves. Students will construct their own portfolio of texts and each week they will (re)analyze them using a different approach; they will record their findings and reflect on their experiences in a weekly log. The course will comprise asynchronous activities (lectures, presentations, assignments, readings) and one synchronous meeting per week to discuss the readings. Approaches may include: formalism, structuralism, Marxism, psychoanalysis, critical approaches to identity and performance (gender, race, sexuality and disability), network analysis, topic modeling, stylometry, and word embeddings.

How can we live in a highly imperfect world? And what can film do that other media can't? We'll think about all of these great questions with the help of films that are philosophically stimulating, stylistically intriguing, and, for the most part, gripping to watch: Do The Right Thing (Lee), The Dark Knight (Nolan), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Kaufman), Arrival (Villeneuve), My Dinner with André (Malle), Blade Runner (Scott), La Jetée (Marker), Fight Club (Fincher), No Country for Old Men (Coen), The Seventh Seal (Bergman), and Memento (Nolan).

After discussing the literary ancestors (Sana'i, `Attar), we will trace the mystico-philosophical foundations of Rumi's thought through close readings of the lyrical (Divan-e Shams) and narrative poems (Mathnavi-ye ma`navi), the prose works (Fihe ma fihe), and the letters. Literary analyses will be followed by an exploration of music as a structuring principle in Rumi's work and the role of sama` (spiritual audition) as a poetic practice. From there, we will look at the ritual and symbolism of the dervish dance, the foundation of the Mevlevi order, the interconnectedness of space (architecture) and poetic form that is exemplified in the Mevlevi dervish lodges, and the literary and philosophical echoes of Rumi in Ottoman culture, above all Seyh Galip's masterpiece Hüsn ü Ask (1782).

COMPLIT 188:,"In Search of the Holy Grail: Percival's Quest in Medieval Literature (COMPLIT 388, GERMAN 188, GERMAN 388)","This course focuses on one of the most famous inventions of the Middle Ages: the Holy Grail. The grail - a mysterious vessel with supernatural properties - is first mentioned in Chrétien de Troyes' ""Perceval,"" but the story is soon rewritten by authors who alter the meaning of both the grail and the quest. By reading three different versions, we will explore how they respond differently to major topics in medieval culture and relevant to today: romantic love, family ties, education, moral guilt, and spiritual practice. The texts are: Chrétien de Troyes' ""Perceval,"" Wolfram von Eschenbach's ""Parzival,"" and the anonymous ""Queste del Saint Graal."" All readings will be available in English."
COMPLIT 204A:,Digital Humanities Across Borders (DLCL 204),"What if you could take a handwritten manuscript, or a pile of 100 books, and map all the locations that are referenced, or see which characters interact with one another, or how different translators adapted the same novel -- without reading through each text to manually compile those lists? Digital humanities tools and methods make it possible, but most tools and tutorials assume the texts are in English. If you work with text (literature, historical documents, fanfic, tweets, or any other textual material) in languages other than English, DLCL 204 is for you. No previous programming or other technical experience is required, just a reading knowledge of a language other than English (modern or historical). We'll cover the whole process of using digital tools, from start to finish: text acquisition, text enrichment, and analysis/visualization, all of which have applications in a wide range of job contexts within and beyond academia."

We will read harrowing stories of being caught adrift at sea and mystical interpretations of island desertion. The course begins with sea-dominated stories of Portuguese voyages to Asia, Africa, and Brazil then turns to how the Amazon and the sertão, or backlands, became a driving force of Brazilian literature. Official historians, poets, and novelists imbued the ocean and the backlands with romanticism, yet these spaces were the backdrop to slavery and conquest. Instead of approaching shipwreck and captivity narratives as eyewitness testimonies, as many have, we will consider how they produced 'the sea' and 'the wilderness' as poetic constructions in Western literature while also offering glimpses of the 'darker side' of Iberian expansion. Taught in English with all texts offered both in English and the original Portuguese or Spanish. Optional guest lectures in Portuguese."
COMPLIT 237:,Fascism after Fascism (GERMAN 237),"When World War II ended, most of the states that described themselves as ""fascist"" ended with it. Nevertheless, fascism haunted postwar democracy as an ever-present threat. The question of what exactly had characterized fascism, and what parts of it persisted within liberal democracies themselves, were continuously and contentiously debated. This question has emerged all the more forcefully in recent years as ""illiberal,"" or ""right-wing populist,"" movements and governments have begun to question the basic premises of liberal democracy. What was fascism, and what would it mean for it to return? This course considers writings by philosophers, historians, journalists and writers, and moves from early anti-fascist writings to critiques of online movements and neo-reactionaries."
COMPLIT 243:,The Age of Beloveds: Inflections of Desire in Persian and Ottoman Literature,"This course follows the trajectory of Islamicate love poetry from its emergence in medieval Persian letters to the court of the Ottoman Sultans. Our point of departure will be the emergence of a unique doctrine of love in Persian literature between the 11th and the 14th centuries, from the confluence of courtly, romantic and mystical ideas. Tracing the gradual imbrication of sacred and profane desire, we will study the advice on marital love in early Mirrors for Princes, the exaltation of heterosexual love in romances, the recasting of love in the context of a mystical erotology, and, finally, the enduring legacy of this discourse of love in ghazal poetry. We will then explore the theme of love, oscillating between heterosexual, homoerotic, and mystical in Ottoman lyric poetry by Sufi, Sultan, and woman poets, spreading over four hundred years until the 19th century. In looking at these texts, we will touch upon questions regarding the ideals and realities of love in Persian and Ottoman society, the protean nature and all-encompassing scope of longing in Perso-Ottoman letters, and the metaphysical implications of the hierarchical structure underlying the Persianate codes of love. Open to undergraduates and graduates. Taught in English."
COMPLIT 243A:,From Idol to Equal: Changing Images of Love in 20th-Century Persian and Turkish Literature,"This course will explore the changing images of love in pivotal works of modern Persian and Turkish literature. Classes will include close readings and discussions of poems, short stories, and plays with particular attention to the constellation of lover/beloved, the theme of romantic love, and the cultural and historical background of these elements. Our starting point will be the adoption of the novel as a form in the late 19th century. From there, we will explore different figurations of love in key texts of the 20th century up to the Islamic Revolution in Iran (1978) and the coup d'état in Turkey (1980). Themes will include the end of empire and the demise of the concubine, the portrayal of the homeland as lover, secularization and the lifting of the veil, the figure of the female pioneer, the conflict of western and eastern morals, the prostitute as a new paradigm, the emergence of female writers, and avantgarde conceptions of love.

COMPLIT 249B:,Iranian Cinema in Diaspora (GLOBAL 249B),"Despite enormous obstacles, immigrant Iranian filmmakers, within a few decades (after the Iranian Revolution), have created a slow but steady stream of films outside Iran. They were originally started by individual spontaneous attempts from different corners of the world and by now we can identify common lines of interest amongst them. There are also major differences between them. These films have never been allowed to be screened inside Iran, and without any support from the global system of production and distribution, as independent and individual attempts, they have enjoyed little attention. Despite all this, Iranian cinema in exile is in no sense any less important than Iranian cinema inside Iran. In this course we will view one such film, made outside Iran, in each class meeting and expect to reach a common consensus in identifying the general patterns within these works and this movement. Questions such as the ones listed below will be addressed in our meetings each week: What more »"
COMPLIT 249C:,Contemporary Iranian Theater (GLOBAL 249C),"Today, Iranian plays both in traditional and contemporary styles are staged in theater festivals throughout the world and play their role in forming a universal language of theater which combine the heritages from countries in all five continents. Despite many obstacles, some Iranian plays have been translated into English and some prominent Iranian figures are successful stage directors outside Iran. Forty-six years ago when ""Theater in Iran"" (a monograph on the history of Iranian plays) by Bahram Beyzaie was first published, it put the then contemporary Iranian theater movement ""which was altogether westernizing itself blindly"" face to face with a new kind of self-awareness. Hence, today's generation of playwrights and stage directors in Iran, all know something of their theatrical heritage. In this course we will spend some class sessions on the history of theater in Iran and some class meetings will be concentrating on contemporary movements and present day playwrights.

Were the Americas a 'New World,' unknown to the ancients, entirely detached from the rest of human history? Even after the invasion and occupation of the Americas, many European chroniclers continued to think that the world was divided into three parts - Europe, Asia, and Africa. In their descriptions of the Americas, they drew heavily on histories and travel reports pertaining to other epochs and locales, especially contemporary Asia and ancient Rome. At the same time, indigenous elites and mestizo authors in the Americas used 'Old World' history and news of distant conflicts to reflect on the immediacy of their historical experience.

In this course, we will examine the coming of age as children grow up to become adults, learn and negotiate layers of hierarchies of authority, class, gender, and violence in the Middle East /West Asia. We will trace the role of capitalism, colonialism and modernization, which shapes the global history in the meanings and experiences of the youth from major and minor ethnic, language or religious communities of the region. To do so, we will explore the graphic novel genre, a hybrid form that became very popular among Middle Eastern artists and writers who mastered it to narrate their personal stories interwoven in the region's sociopolitical and cultural issues. Through these graphic novels, we will learn not only how to understand the commonalities and differences of the writers' respective societies' history, culture and politics but also how to more »"

(COMPLIT 251A, CSRE 251, CSRE 351, HISTORY 271C, HISTORY 371C, ILAC 251, ILAC 351)","The conquerors, missionaries, and historians who reflected on Iberian overseas expansion during the early modern period often asked themselves a crucial question: was there only one world or many? Were the Americas a 'New World,' unknown to the ancients, entirely detached from the rest of human history? Even after the invasion and occupation of the Americas, many European chroniclers continued to think that the world was divided into three parts - Europe, Asia, and Africa. In their descriptions of the Americas, they drew heavily on histories and travel reports pertaining to other epochs and locales, especially contemporary Asia and ancient Rome. At the same time, indigenous elites and mestizo authors in the Americas used 'Old World' history and news of distant conflicts to reflect on the immediacy of their historical experience. In this course, students will consider the ways in which diverse authors in New Spain (Mexico), Peru, and Brazil contemplated themselves in relation to remote more »"

CSRE 22:,Lockdown America: Race and Incarceration in the Land of the Free,"This course is about prisons, jails, and the place they hold in American life, drawing heavily from the instructor's experiences of fieldwork in prisons and jails in the San Francisco Bay Area. Prisons and Jails are commonly imagined as isolated places, behind high walls, wire fences, and metal doors. The story ends as the 'bad guy' is sent to prison, after all. The reality is far from this; what happens in and around prison and jails impacts American society, culture, economics, geography, and daily life in myriad ways. This course undertakes to undo many of the myths and misconceptions about incarceration and place the prison back in the American landscape. Using a wide variety of sources of data (news articles, blog posts, essays, academic articles and book chapters, podcasts and documentaries) and prioritizing the voices of incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people, this course encourages students to critically interrogate the terms used to describe and justify mass incarcerati more »"

Some of the things we will consider when taking on the analysis of a new world include: What are its primary features - spatial, cultural, biological, fantastic, cosmological? What is the world's ethos (the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize the world)? What are the precise strategies that are used by the artist to convey the world to us and us to the world?

From the 'scientific' origins of the concept of race in the 18th century to contemporary algorithms that attempt to detect a person's race from their image, we will explore how social ideas about race are both embedded in and transformed by technology. We will also highlight how communities of color have resisted the encroachment of harmful technologies and developed alternatives that promote racial justice. Topics covered will include: algorithmic bias, policing and borders, surveillance, disinformation, data colonialism, and labor issues like micro-tasking and data annotation.

We will use improvisational scores, meteorological data, gaming and machine learning strategies to both become weather and respond to weather. Through this poetic simulator, we will devise a collective way of thinking about our survival and our creative agency. How does weather change our way of being? How is the weather affected by human behavior on earth? In an unpredictable world of climate catastrophes, how can our simulator inspire hope through collective imagination grounded in science? The Chocolate Heads will continue the practice of creating intermedia performances using dance, film projection, technology, and live music. We are seeking interdisciplinary artists in dance, poetry, music, graphics, video and AI. All levels of experience are welcome. WEEK 1: TU 9/27--Introduction to the Project & CHs Band; THU 9/29--1st Audition Workshop. Contact Instructor (Aleta Hayes, ahayes1@stanford.edu) for more information."
DANCE 30S:,"Dance 30S: Chocolate Heads ""Weather Simulator"" Project: Where Choreography Meets Design","Although dance is the main event, there is no limit to the elements you can use when creating a dance production. The work that happens in the studio with collaborators from different disciplines can be a space to expand the dancer's sense of performance and visual installation. When theatrical elements truly complement the physical performance, the audience is allowed to be immersed in the experience of embodied imagination. The Winter 22-23 project will be dedicated to the dance theater production of the ongoing Chocolate Heads ""Weather Simulator"" Project. In Autumn 22-23, we began generating the choreographic and conceptual framework. This quarter, we will continue the process of creating our ""weather simulator"" as a vehicle to explore the relationship between weather and human social life. We will engage with a variety of theatrical elements and genres of performance-making to deliver an impactful intermedia event that will be performed as part of the Spring Dance Faculty Concert. more »"

DANCE 103I:,Interdiscipline: Channeling Impulse into Form,"This course is about discovering the wonderment of dance through an interdisciplinary lens. The more disciplines we interface with through dance, the more rich and surprising the outcomes will be. When our primal urges for expression are interfaced with technology (any tool) they become rendered as artifacts, as something `real' in the world. By repurposing those artifacts and folding them back into dance we can significantly deepen the complexity and quality of our dance expression. This course is a manual for finding more depth, more truthfulness and ultimately honing your excellence in dancing, in order to find meaning and serve purpose for others.This course is designed to radically deconstruct assumptions about Contact Improvisation and contemporary dance, in order to reassemble new possibilities for individual expression.

DANCE 123:,Choreography: Hot Mess & Deliberate Failure as Practice,"A dance class in how we become the worst dancer possible. The foundation of this class has many parts. One is that, in almost every respect the way we gain insight into anything is to understand more clearly its polarity. As a class we purposely explore chaos, failure, and ""bad"" dancing, with the hope that then we will have a greater chance to understand and refine our personal notions around beauty. The class also acknowledges that creativity is at times born from the loss of control. Instead of looking at this idea obliquely, Hot Mess looks at this directly by having dancers confront a number of movement and vocal prompts that are literally impossible to execute in any good way. This class embraces and celebrates destabilization, with all the exuberance, fear, and learning that can happen when we accept and practice being lost."
DANCE 142:,Intermediate/Advanced Contemporary Dance Technique,"This intermediate/advanced dance technique class is grounded in the technical training, aesthetic sensibilities, and choreographic processes of Merce Cunningham, American dancer/master choreographer. This studio work at an intermediate/advanced level will build technical strength, speed, line, and rhythmic acuity/musicality and amplitude in dancing. The class will provides solid technical training useful and applicable to other forms of dancing. Dancers must be ready to work at an intermediate/advanced level to enroll. Studio practice will be supplemented by readings, video viewing, concert attendance, and participation in special workshops with guest artists.

May be repeated for credit."
DANCE 196:,"Dancing Black: Embodying the African Diaspora in the United States and the Caribbean (TAPS 196, TAPS 396)","What does it mean to dance black? How can studying comparative dance practices across the United States and the Caribbean expose continuities and differences in African diaspora experience? How can we draw strategies from black performance to inform our current movements for social change? This class will explore how dance and writing about performance have shaped notions of what it means to identify or be marked as an African diaspora subject. From the ring shouts of captive Africans to the 20th-century concert dance stage, from New York queer ballroom culture to Tiktok fads, this class will expose students to both historical and ethnographic methods for using dance to study the formation of black community in the New World. Looking beyond the surface of skin, we'll explore how race is experienced in muscle and flesh, and how black performers have historically taken advantage of or disavowed racialized ideas of how they can/should move. We will read theories of diaspora, queer of colo more »"

ECON 1V:,Principles of Economics,"The course covers all of economics at a basic level. It stresses the key idea that economics is about making purposeful choice with limited resources and about people interacting with other people as they make these choices. Most of those interactions occur in markets, and the course is mainly about markets, including labor markets and capital markets. We show why free competitive markets can improve people's lives and how they have removed millions from people from poverty, with many more, we hope, to come; we show how monopolies and environmental spillovers cause market failures; we show how to remedy these failures through government policy; and we explain why government failure can also be a problem. The overall goal is to use economics to understand the big issues of the day including economic growth, inequality, crises, and unemployment.

EE 376D:,Wireless Information Theory,"Information theory forms the basis for the design of all modern day communication systems. The original theory was primarily point-to-point, studying how fast information can flow across an isolated noisy communication channel. Until recently, there has been only limited success in extending the theory to a network of interacting nodes. Progress has been made in the past decade driven by engineering interest in wireless networks. The course provides a unified overview of this recent progress made in information theory of wireless networks. Starting with an overview of the capacity of fading and multiple-antenna wireless channels, we aim to answer questions such as: What is the optimal way for users to cooperate and exchange information in a wireless network? How much benefit can optimal cooperation provide over traditional communication architectures? How can cooperation help to deal with interference between multiple wireless transmissions?

ENERGY 13SC:,Energy in Hawaii: Forefront of Clean Energy Technology and Policy (POLISCI 28SC),"We will explore practical, social, technical, and political issues surrounding energy production and use in Hawaii. Hawaii is at the forefront of changes in the electric grid and the uses of electricity, with an aspirational goal for 100% carbon-free electricity in 2045. Hawaii also has passed legislation that aspires to 100% fossil-free transportation by 2040. Significant growth of behind-the-meter solar generation with storage has led to opportunities for the better use of these resources for maintaining grid reliability, while also increasing concerns related to grid stability and social equity. Because of these factors, there is a heightened interest nationally from federal agencies, particularly Energy and Defense. We will consider the availability and viability of solar, wind, and geothermal resources, while also considering the economic impact on Hawaii of large-scale importation of oil for generating electricity and transportation. We will consider emerging questions related to more »"

ENGLISH 16Q:,Family Stories,"This creative writing workshop will explore the idea of family. We'll begin with our questions: How do we conceptualize the word family? How do family histories, stories, mythologies, and languages shape our narratives? What does family have to do with the construction of a self? How can we investigate the self and all of its many contexts in writing? We'll consider how we might work from our questions in order to craft work that is meaningful and revealing. Students will have the opportunity to write in both poetry and prose, as well as to develop their own creative cross-genre projects. Along the way, we'll discuss elements of craft essential to strong writing: how to turn the self into a speaker; how create the world of a piece through image, detail, and metaphor; how to craft beautiful sentences and lines; how to find a form; and many other topics."
ENGLISH 21Q:,Write Like a Poet: From Tradition to Innovation,"In this poetry workshop, we will spend the first half of the quarter reading and writing in traditional forms and the second half innovating from those forms. When discussing poetry, what do we mean when we talk about craft? What is prosody and why is it important? What are the relationships between form and content? What does a modern sonnet look like? We will consider how a writer might honor a tradition without being confined by it. The culmination of the course will be a project in which the student invents (and writes in) a form of their own. All interested students are welcome beginners and experts alike."
ENGLISH 24Q:,Leaving Patriarchy: A Course for All Genders,"This is a creative writing course for writers of all genders who are interested in thinking about patriarchy and how to resist it. Our course will aim to complicate the idea that men benefit from patriarchy and are its primary enforcers, while the rest of us are simply suffering under it. We'll ask ourselves how patriarchy is bad for ALL of us, and how ALL of us are implicated in its perpetuation. Do we ALL have the reasons and the resources to leave patriarchy--and can we start to leave it right now? We'll read works of scholarship and literature that investigate patriarchy as a human relational problem. We'll write fiction and nonfiction in which we explore the ways patriarchy has shaped us, challenge ourselves to resist its manifestations in our relationships, envision a future without patriarchy, and begin to live that future right now. Most crucially, we will practice creating a space in which all of us can speak without fear of judgment about our experiences of a fraught topic."
ENGLISH 25Q:,Queer Stories (FEMGEN 25Q),"Queer Stories is a creative writing class open to any and all students, regardless of how they define their gender or sexuality. The goals of the class are to read widely in the canon of twentieth and twenty-first century queer prose literature, and to write critical and creative work that engages with the styles, modes, and subjects of these writers. As we read and discuss texts, students will consider a variety of questions: How has queer romance, relationships, and sexuality been represented over the years, in both coded and explicit ways? How have writers grappled with representing our evolving sense of gender as a continuum rather than a binary? How have queer writers interrogated or understood the concept of family? How do queer writers handle the question of the ""universal"" reader to whom, arguably, they might be speaking? (In a 2012 interview with Lambda Literary, book critic Daniel Mendelsohn argues,contentiously, ""It is precisely the gay book's ability to be interesting to a more »"
ENGLISH 27Q:,The Childhood Novel,"In this course, we will consider the first volumes of three ambitious literary projects: Marcel Proust's IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME; Elena Ferrante's NEOPOLITAN NOVELS; and Karl Ove Knausgaard MY STRUGGLE. These writers, and the novels they wrote, may seem, at first glance, to be very different. Proust was a gay French writer, born in 1871. Ferrante is a reclusive Italian novelist whose identity has, for many years, been a mystery (including her year of birth). Knausgaard is a kind of literary rock star, a Norwegian novelist of immense fame. But all three novelists share a fascination with childhood, and all three novelists have produced works that walk a very fine line between fiction and memoir, imagination and memory. In reading the first volumes of these three long novel sequences, we'll consider what aspects of the writer's life are fit for the page. At what point does the novelist's allegiance to the recollection of their own particular past give way to their invention of a fictional world we can only dwell in? What is the difference between Proust, Ferrante and Knausgaard's first-person narrators and Proust, Ferrante and Knausgaard themselves? And what lessons might we draw from these novelists and novels when it comes to writing about our own childhood experiences?"
ENGLISH 39Q:,"Were They Really ""Hard Times""? Mid-Victorian Social Movements and Charles Dickens (HISTORY 39Q)","""It was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it."" So begins Charles Dickens description of Coketown in Hard Times. And it only seems to get more grim from there. But the world that Dickens sought to portray in the novel was a hopeful one, too. And that tension is our starting point. The intent of this class is to more closely examine mid-Victorian Britain in light of Dickens' novel, with particular focus on the rise of some of our modern social movements in the 19th century. While things like the labor movement, abolitionism, feminism, and environmentalism, are not the same now as they were then, this class will explore the argument that the 21st century is still, in some ways, working out 19th century problems and questions. At the same time, this is also a course that seeks to expand the kinds of sources we traditionally use as historians. Thus, while recognizing that literary sources are particularly complex, we will use Hard T more »"
ENGLISH 71:,"Dangerous Ideas (ARTHIST 36, COMPLIT 36A, EALC 36, ETHICSOC 36X, FRENCH 36, HISTORY 3D, MUSIC 36H, PHIL 36, POLISCI 70, RELIGST 36X, SLAVIC 36, TAPS 36)","Ideas matter. Concepts such as equality, tradition, and Hell have inspired social movements, shaped political systems, and dramatically influenced the lives of individuals. Others, like race, gender, and technology play an important role in contemporary debates in the United States. All of these ideas are contested, and they have a real power to change lives, for better and for worse. In this one-unit class we will examine these ""dangerous"" ideas. Each week, a faculty member from a different department in the humanities and arts will explore a concept that has shaped human experience across time and space."
ENGLISH 90M:,Queer Stories (FEMGEN 90M),"Like other 90 and 91-level courses, 90M will explore basic elements of fiction and nonfiction writing. Students will read a wide variety of stories and essays in order to develop a language for working through the themes, forms, and concerns of the queer prose canon. Students will complete and workshop a piece of writing that in some way draws upon the aesthetics or sensibilities of the work we have read, culled from exercises completed throughout the quarter. This final piece may be a short story, a personal essay, a chapter from a novel or memoir, or a piece that, in the spirit of queerness, blurs or interrogates standard demarcations of genre. The course is open to any and all students, regardless of how they define their gender or sexuality. NOTE: First priority to undergrads. Students must attend the first class meeting to retain their roster spot."
ENGLISH 90QN:,"Quantum Narratives:Writing Fiction about Science, Philosophy and Human Experience in the Quantum Age","Classical modes of storytelling have served writers and readers for centuries, but with mainstream recognition of the complexities and uncertainties that underpin reality, might there also exist less traditional, but perhaps truer, modes of storytelling? Shouldn't our narrative approaches be updated to incorporate quantum realities such as uncertainty, superposition and 'spooky action?' Can characters become entangled or exist in many worlds? What are the narrative implications of a black hole? This course hopes to examine the assertion by Cixin Liu, in his novel The Three-Body Problem, that 'Science fiction is a literature that belongs to all humankind,' as it transcends culture, language and individual experience. Designed for writers and readers interested in exploring the narrative implications and possibilities of science, computing and AI, this workshop-focused course will combine readings, writing exercises and story crafting. Open to writers of all levels and backgrounds, the focus will be on research/science-based narrative rather than fantasy/folkloric writing. (i.e. wormholes, okay; elves and dragons, not so much.)"
ENGLISH 90W:,Writing and War,"This introductory, five-unit course is designed for all students interested in reading the literature of and studying the expression of military conflict. Bridging the experiences of Veteran and non-Veteran students will be a central aim of the course and will be reflected in enrollment, reading materials, visiting guests and final narrative project."
ENGLISH 91DC:,Writing the Memoir,"Open to DCI Fellows and Partners only. In this course, we will practice the art and craft of writing memoir: works of prose inspired by the memory of personal events and history. In our practice, we will look at different strategies for writing with meaning and insight about the events in our lives. We will read a variety of models by published authors who have made sense of the personal alongside the profound: the sad, joyful, simple and complicated stuff of living and being alive. Our learning will be discussion-driven. You should expect to do daily writing in the class, and to write and read widely between our class meetings. We will read, discuss, and imitate excerpts of memoirs by such authors as Augustine, Andrew Solomon, Joyce Carol Oates, Tim O'Brien, Joan Didion, and Eavan Boland, among many others. At least half of our class time will be devoted to the discussion of participants' work. The course will address issues ranging from how we select and write about events from our personal lives, to the ethical obligations of memoirists, to the ways we can explore new understanding about the past, as well as our own courage and reluctance to share personal writing. Writers at all levels of experience and comfort with creative writing are very welcome."
ENGLISH 91DF:,Documentary Fictions,"More and more of the best American fiction, plays, and even comics are being created out of documentary practices such as in-depth interviewing, oral histories, and reporting. Novels like Dave Eggers' What is the What, plays like Anna Deavere Smith's Twilight: Los Angeles, and narrative journalism like Rebecca Skloot's The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, all act as both witnesses and translators of people's direct experience and push art into social activism in new ways. In this course students will examine the research methods, artistic craft, and ethics of these rich, genre-bending works and then create documentary fictions of their own. Readings will include works by Truman Capote, Dave Eggers, and Lisa Taddeo, as well as Katherine Boo, author of the award-winning Behind the Beautiful Forevers, who will visit the class. No prior creative writing or journalism experience required. Note: First priority to undergrads. Students must attend the first class meeting to retain their roster spot."
ENGLISH 92AP:,Arab and Arab-American Poetry (CSRE 92D),"In this introductory course, students will write and read widely, exploring various aspects of poetic craft, including imagery, metaphor, line, stanza, music, rhythm, diction, and tone. The course will focus primarily on the rich and varied tradition of Arab and Arab-American poets, with a special emphasis on contemporary poets exploring the intersections of cultural identity, nationhood, race, gender, and sexuality. The first half of the course will consist of close reading a selection of poems, while the second half of the course will consist of workshopping student writing. Through peer critique, students respond closely to the work of fellow writers in a supportive workshop. Writers at all levels of experience and comfort with poetry are welcome.nNOTE: First priority to undergrads. Students must attend the first class meeting to retain their roster spot."
ENGLISH 94Q:,The Future is Feminine (FEMGEN 94Q),"Gender is one of the great social issues of our time. What does it mean to be female or feminine? How has femininity been defined, performed, punished, or celebrated? Writers are some of our most serious and eloquent investigators of these questions, and in this class we'll read many of our greatest writers on the subject of femininity, as embodied by both men and women, children and adults, protagonists and antagonists. From Virginia Woolf to Ernest Hemingway, from Beloved to Gone Girl (and even ""RuPaul's Drag Race""), we'll ask how the feminine is rendered and contested. We'll do so in order to develop a history and a vocabulary of femininity so that we may, in this important time, write our own way in to the conversation.

ENGLISH 112C:,Humanities Core: The Renaissance in Europe (HUMCORE 122),"The Renaissance in Europe saw a cultural flowering founded on the achievements of pagan antiquity, a new humanism founded on the conviction that nothing which has ever interested living men and women can wholly lose its vitality, and the foundation of the modern state. We start with those ""Renaissance men"" Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael. We then turn to Martin Luther's rejection of Papal Rome and his erection of a competing, Protestant ideal. Montaigne and Shakespeare invent our modern sense of subjectivity before our eyes. And Machiavelli and Hobbes create a science of power politics. Each week, during the first class meeting, we will focus on these issues in Europe. During the second class meeting, we will participate in a collaborative conversation with the other students and faculty in Humanities Core classes, about other regions and issues. This course is taught in English . This course is part of the Humanities Core, a collaborative set of global humanities seminars that brings all of its students and faculty into conversation. On Mondays you meet in your own course, and on Wednesdays all the HumCore seminars (in session that quarter) meet together: https://humanitiescore.stanford.edu/."
ENGLISH 115:,"Virtual Italy (ARCHLGY 117, CLASSICS 115, HISTORY 238C, ITALIAN 115)","Classical Italy attracted thousands of travelers throughout the 1700s. Referring to their journey as the ""Grand Tour,"" travelers pursued intellectual passions, promoted careers, and satisfied wanderlust, all while collecting antiquities to fill museums and estates back home. What can computational approaches tell us about who traveled, where and why? We will read travel accounts; experiment with parsing; and visualize historical data. Final projects to form credited contributions to the Grand Tour Project, a cutting-edge digital platform. No prior programming experience necessary."
ENGLISH 154F:,"Film & Philosophy (COMPLIT 154A, FRENCH 154, ITALIAN 154, PHIL 193C, PHIL 293C)","What makes you the individual you are? Should you plan your life, or make it up as you go along? Is it always good to remember your past? Is it always good to know the truth? When does a machine become a person? What do we owe to other people? Is there always a right way to act? How can we live in a highly imperfect world? And what can film do that other media can't? We'll think about all of these great questions with the help of films that are philosophically stimulating, stylistically intriguing, and, for the most part, gripping to watch: Do The Right Thing (Lee), The Dark Knight (Nolan), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Kaufman), Arrival (Villeneuve), My Dinner with André (Malle), Blade Runner (Scott), La Jetée (Marker), Fight Club (Fincher), No Country for Old Men (Coen), The Seventh Seal (Bergman), and Memento (Nolan).

ENGLISH 157H:,"Creative Writing & Science: The Artful Interpreter (OCEANS 157, OCEANS 257H)","What role does creativity play in the life of a scientist? How has science inspired great literature? How do you write accessibly and expressively about things like whales, DNA or cancer? This course begins with a field trip to Hopkins Marine Station where Stanford labs buzz with activity alongside barking seals and crashing waves. The trip provides a unique opportunity for students to directly engage with marine animals, coastal habitats and environmental concerns of Monterey Bay. As historian Jill Lepore writes of Rachel Carson: ""She could not have written Silent Spring if she hadn't, for decades, scrambled down rocks, rolled up her pant legs, and waded into tide pools, thinking about how one thing can change another..."" Back on campus students will complete and workshop three original nonfiction essays that explore the intersection between personal narrative and scientific curiosity. You will develop a more patient and observant eye and improve your ability to articulate scientific concepts to a general readership. **This course takes place on main campus and is open to all undergraduate students. NOTE: Students must attend the first class meeting to retain their roster spot."
ENGLISH 158H:,"Science Meets Literature on the Monterey Peninsula (BIOHOPK 158H, BIOHOPK 258H)","(Graduate students register for 258H.) This course will consider the remarkable nexus of scientific research and literature that developed on the Monterey Peninsula in the first half of the 20th century and how the two areas of creativity influenced each other. The period of focus begins with the 1932 association of John and Carol Steinbeck, Ed Ricketts, and Joseph Campbell, all of whom were highly influenced by the Carmel poet, Robinson Jeffers ¿ and ends with the novels Cannery Row (1945) and Sweet Thursday (1954). An indisputable high-tide mark, Sea of Cortez: A Leisurely of Travel and Research (1941) will be considered in detail. Weekend field trips will include intertidal exploration, a tour of the Jeffers Tor House in Carmel, and whale watching on Monterey Bay."
ENGLISH 159:,"James Baldwin & Twentieth Century Literature (AFRICAAM 159, AMSTUD 159, FEMGEN 159)","Black, gay and gifted, Baldwin was hailed as a ""spokesman for the race"", although he personally, and controversially, eschewed titles and classifications of all kinds. This course examines his classic novels and essays as well his exciting work across many lesser-examined domains - poetry, music, theatre, sermon, photo-text, children's literature, public media, comedy and artistic collaboration. Placing his work in context with other writers of the 20C (Faulkner, Wright, Morrison) and capitalizing on a resurgence of interest in the writer (NYC just dedicated a year of celebration of Baldwin and there are 2 new journals dedicated to study of Baldwin), the course seeks to capture the power and influence of Baldwin's work during the Civil Rights era as well as his relevance in the ""post-race"" transnational 21st century, when his prescient questioning of the boundaries of race, sex, love, leadership and country assume new urgency."
ENGLISH 177B:,Contemporary American Short Stories (AMSTUD 177B),"An exploration of the power and diversity of the American short story ranging from the 1970s to the present day.

ENGLISH 190M:,Intermediate Queer Stories,"Intermediate Queer Stories is a workshop class open to any and all students, regardless of how they define their gender or sexuality. The goals of the class are to read widely in the canon of twentieth and twenty-first century queer prose literature, and to create work that draws on the styles, modes, and subjects of these writers. In the second half of the class, students will workshop a longer piece of their own writing that in some way draws upon the aesthetics or sensibilities of the writers we have read. This piece may be a short story, a personal essay, a chapter from a novel or memoir, or a piece that, in the spirit of queerness, blurs or interrogates standard demarcations of genre."
ENGLISH 224:,Doing Literary History: Orwell in the World (HISTORY 200K),"This course will bring together the disciplines of history and literary studies by looking closely at the work of one major twentieth-century author: the British writer and political polemicist George Orwell. In 1946, Orwell writes, ""What I have most wanted to do throughout the past ten years is to make political writing into an art."" In these years, Orwell writes about-- and often participates in or witnesses first-hand--a series of major events and crises. These include British imperialism in Burma, urban poverty in Europe, class inequality in England, the conflict between Socialism and Fascism in Spain, and the rise of totalitarianism in the Soviet Union. In engaging all of these events, Orwell experiments with different literary forms, moving between fiction and non-fiction, novel and autobiography, essay and memoir, manifesto and fable, literature and journalism. Few writers demand such sustained and equal attention to text and context: in this course we will move back-and-forth between Orwell's varied writing and the urgent social and political contexts it addresses."
ENGLISH 239:,Henry James,"In this course, we will read the three culminating novels of Henry James's 'major phase': The Wings of the Dove, The Ambassadors, and The Golden Bowl. These are among the greatest and most profound novels in English. Many people also find them boring or unreadable. Unquestionably, their prose is difficult, with sentences so complex, wandering, and ambiguous, that the sense may be hard to construe. While very little action occurs, topics illuminated include love, money, sex-gender-sexuality, and evil. These three novels, taken seriously, have unusual powers to illuminate your future life, but also perhaps to mislead or ruin it. All are microscopic studies of social interaction, psychology, and selves. Recommended for very advanced and searching students and readers. Please enroll only if you find difficult prose manageable and rewarding, and you anticipate that these particular novels may speak to you at this stage of your life."
ENGLISH 274:,Comedy and Social Critique,"Comedy has been used to shine a no-holds-barred light on everything from the rise of fascism to the inanities of fashion. Over the decades, it has generated a number of questions. Some of these are ethical. What can we legitimately find funny or make fun of? Are there things we shouldn't laugh at? Can and should comedy be delimited or censored? When does comedy become abuse? When does it become hate speech? Some of the questions we will consider are more general: does comedy change through history? Is it culturally specific? Is it gender-specific? Is there a point at which these specifities give way to the possibility of a form of humor common to us all and the role laughter plays across human cultures. Finally, we will explore the expressive forms of comedy, including parody, satire, slapstick, tragi-comedy, the comics, stand-up, and physical comedy which raises the question of whether comedy can be said to reside in the body. Graduate and undergraduate students welcome."

ESF 10:,Education as Self-Fashioning: Unintended Consequences,"Unintended consequences are outcomes that are not the ones foreseen and/or intended by a new product, action or decision. Some unintended outcomes are very surprising, and would have been hard to predict. Others seem completely logical in hindsight and leaves people wondering why they were not anticipated. For instance, when the first biofuel mandates were imposed in the EU, little did policy makers realize it would lead to a strong rise in palm oil production, which in turn led to tropical deforestation, undoing any of the possible positive impacts of increased biofuels use. In hindsight it is easy to see this potential negative impact, yet at the time the decision was made the EU leadership was blind to it. Not all unintended consequences are negative. Aspirin, for example, was developed to relieve pain, but was found to also be an anticoagulant that can lower the risk of heart attacks. As another example, the setting up of large hunting reserves for nobility in the medieval period preserved green areas, which later could be converted to large parks."

ESS 15N:,Fitting Fish into the Food System,"There is a growing perception that our global food system is broken. Billions of people around the world lack adequate nutrition for healthy and productive lives, and obesity now exceeds hunger even in poor communities. Agricultural practices add to climate change, biodiversity loss, and other environmental harms, and freshwater and soils are widely depleted. Farmers who produce food in many parts of the world may lack the income to feed their own families. What's missing from this conversation about food and agriculture is fish, or more broadly, 'blue foods', animals and plants cultivated or captured in ocean and freshwater systems worldwide. This seminar will explore the role of blue foods in creating a sustainable and healthy global food system.

We will ask questions such as: Is compulsory voting justified? Should children have the right to vote? Is affirmative action just? What is wrong with racial profiling? What are the duties of citizens of affluent countries towards migrants? Do we have a right to privacy? Is giving cash to all unconditionally fair? This class will introduce students to a number of methods and frameworks coming out of ethics and political philosophy and will give students a lot of time to practice ethically informed debates on public policies.

As we read and discuss texts, students will consider a variety of questions: How has queer romance, relationships, and sexuality been represented over the years, in both coded and explicit ways? How have writers grappled with representing our evolving sense of gender as a continuum rather than a binary? How have queer writers interrogated or understood the concept of family? How do queer writers handle the question of the ""universal"" reader to whom, arguably, they might be speaking?

Why have women been the witches and hysterics of the past, while men experienced neurasthenia and schizoid conditions? Why have there historically been more women than men among the mentally ill? How has the emotional and psychological suffering of women differed from that of men, and how has it changed over time? Among the sources we use to explore these questions are memoirs and films such as The Three Faces of Eve and One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. By contrasting the changing ways women and men experienced mental illness and were treated in the past, this seminar will elucidate the historically embedded nature of medical ideas, diagnoses and treatments."

FEMGEN 50Q:,"Life and Death of Words (CSRE 50Q, ENGLISH 50Q, NATIVEAM 50Q)","In this course, we explore the world of words: their creation, evolution, borrowing, change, and death. Words are the key to understanding the culture and ideas of a people, and by tracing the biographies of words we are able to discern how the world was, is, and might be perceived and described. We trace how words are formed, and how they change in pronunciation, spelling, meaning, and usage over time. How does a word get into the dictionary? What do words reveal about status, class, region, and race? How is the language of men and women critiqued differently within our society? How does slang evolve? How do languages become endangered or die, and what is lost when they do? We will visit the Facebook Content Strategy Team and learn more about the role words play in shaping our online experiences.

FEMGEN 94Q:,The Future is Feminine (ENGLISH 94Q),"Gender is one of the great social issues of our time. What does it mean to be female or feminine? How has femininity been defined, performed, punished, or celebrated? Writers are some of our most serious and eloquent investigators of these questions, and in this class we'll read many of our greatest writers on the subject of femininity, as embodied by both men and women, children and adults, protagonists and antagonists. From Virginia Woolf to Ernest Hemingway, from Beloved to Gone Girl (and even ""RuPaul's Drag Race""), we'll ask how the feminine is rendered and contested. We'll do so in order to develop a history and a vocabulary of femininity so that we may, in this important time, write our own way in to the conversation. This is first and foremost a creative writing class, and our goals will be to consider in our own work the importance of the feminine across the entire spectrum of gender, sex, and identity. We will also study how we write about femininity, using other writers as mo more »"

How did subjects of British India respond to colonial rule? When and how did anti-colonial nationalism emerge in South Asia? How did leading thinkers of the region conceptualize the nature of colonialism and the methods of nationalist resistance? Did nationalism represent all social classes in British India? Did it also alienate and exclude? What tactics of resistance were developed in anti-colonial movements, especially by M. K. Gandhi? Why did independence arrive with the partition of British India into two nation-states - India and Pakistan? How did the colonial legacy shape the post-colonial nation-states of South Asia? In this this introductory lecture-based survey course on the history of modern South Asia, we will explore the answers to these questions. The course will span the period from the beginning of the nineteenth to the middle of the twentieth century, and cover the regions that constitute present day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.

FEMGEN 106Q:,Gender and Media,"From childhood, individuals are presented with texts and images about what it means to be female, what it means to be male, but rarely what it means to question that binary. These images and texts also present what it means to be in relationship with one another, and what it means to reject established gender roles. In this course, students will examine and research how lessons learned from popular culture impact the treatment and expectations of people individually as well as in relationship with each other. Specifically, we will analyze the ways in which news articles, movie clips, magazine advertisements, television commercials as well as other texts present gender identities as binary as well as gender roles of those binary structures. How are the roles and bodies of all genders presented as objects open to scrutiny, critique, exploitation, abuse, and awe? After examining rhetorical strategies and devices, we¿ll read excerpts from texts by social critics such as Susan Bordo who analyze culture and it¿s presentation of bodies. Through case studies of films and campaign ads, visits to spaces on campus that construct gender binaries, and field trips to off campus sites, we will explore how representations of gender challenge or reinforce messages in popular media."
FEMGEN 107M:,College Culture & Masculinity,"Students in this course will interrogate masculinity and its impacts on culture broadly, with a focus on college campuses. Some questions considered will include: How do structures and expectations of masculinity impact sexual assault and response to sexual assault? Where on campus do we see pressure to perform masculinity? What expectations do some campus communities, such as athletics and Greek life, have of their members to perform and maintain masculinity? How are male identifying individuals expected to behave in communities shaped by masculinity? What spaces are there for gender non-conforming folks in communities shaped by masculinity? How do structures of masculinity impact expectations of femininity and femme in these spaces and others?"

FEMGEN 109:,"Looking Back, Moving Forward: Raising Critical Awareness in Gender and Sports (FEMGEN 209)","In 1972, Title IX legislation opened up a vast range of opportunities for women in sports. Since then, women's sports have continued to grow yet the fight for recognition and equality persists. Simply put, men's sports are more popular than women's--so much so, in fact, that people often make the hierarchical distinction between ""sports"" and ""women's sports."" But what would it take to get more women's sports featured on ESPN or more female athletes on the cover of Sports Illustrated? And, given the well-documented corruption at the highest levels of men's sports, should such an ascent in popularity be the goal for women's sports? This course will map out and respond to the multifaceted issues that emerge when women enter the sports world. Throughout the quarter, we will explore the fight for gender equality in sports through historical, cultural, and rhetorical lenses. NOTE: Class will meet in Old Union, Room 302"
FEMGEN 113:,Transgender Studies (FEMGEN 213),"Transgender and gender-expansive identities are the subject of growing attention and (often sensationalist) interest in the media as well as in the healthcare field, yet there exists a dearth of legitimate academic courses, research and writing that reflect and explore gender identity and expression as a fluid spectrum rather than a fixed binary. This course will address transgender and gender expansive identities from historical, medical, literary, developmental and sociopolitical perspectives."

Feminists of color who study the politics of popular media have critiqued as well as expanded on Mulvey's notion of the male gaze, including bell hook's articulation of an oppositional gaze¿a critical gaze¿a possible site of resistance for colonized black people.nnWithin the last two decades, reality television has become a staple of popular culture in the U.S., a key component of the representational politics of audiovisual media.

At the same time, science and technology are often lauded as objective systems capable of producing color- and gender-blind truths and social good for all of us. This course pushes beyond the headlines and the hashtags to think about the complex relationship between gender, race and science. Together we will research chronically understudied voices and contributions in the history of science and technology and have the opportunity to read and participate in some of the efforts to highlight their stories through a Wikipedia edit-a-thon and final research project. We will also rigorously think through why the historical and current under-representation of women and people of color matters for the questions that are asked, methodologies that are used, and science and technology that is eventually produced.

Everything about #MeToo can be found in Virginia Woolf's works, from gender oppression, to the politics of women's entry into the public sphere, to the struggle of women to be heard and believed. We begin with A Room of One's Own (1929) and Three Guineas (1938), tying them to media coverage of #MeToo, then turn to the identity politics of her fiction and to broader histories of feminism and feminist theory."
FEMGEN 131:,"Is Visibility a Trap (Door)? Gender, Race, and the Stakes of Representation (CSRE 131A, FILMEDIA 131)","This course examines key theoretical debates surrounding the fraught political and epistemological potential of visibility and representation. Who gets to set the premises for recognition, and how do sexuality, gender, and race affect the ways in which representation is granted or disciplined? What is the relationship between historical (in)visibility and futurity, or between media representation and the neoliberal rhetoric surrounding 'diversity'? If visibility is, in some senses, something 'one cannot not want' in Spivak's famous words, then how do we hold onto critiques of racial capitalism's spectacularization and pinkwashing in the face of yearnings for 'better' images of abjected groups? Can we locate a trap door in visibility's trappings?

As a mode of Black feminist thought, lived activist practice, and interdisciplinary research methodology, intersectionality allows us to think about overlapping forms of identity and the interlocking power structures that produce systematic oppression and discrimination. We will examine the origins and development of intersectional feminism and consider its far-reaching impact in social justice work and contemporary activist movements. As we learn the language, methods, and critiques of intersectionality, we will cover issues related to rights, ethics, privilege, and globalization while discussing social difference on micro- and macro-levels."

FEMGEN 133T:,Transatlantic Female Modernists,"How did American and British women writers express their experiences of modernity? A major critical lens on modernism interrogates questions of gender and sexuality, including how women expressed the experiences of `writing as a woman during these years (1910-1940). But distinctions of race, class, culture, nation, and literary inheritance were powerful determinants on how individual writers gave voice to their creative aspirations. This course explores what binds and what differentiates various forms of aesthetic, political, and cultural representation in the works of pioneering transatlantic innovators: Virginia Woolf; Charlotte Perkins Gilman; Zora Neale Hurston; Djuna Barnes; Katherine Mansfield; Nella Larson; Amy Lowell; H.D.; Jessie Fauset; Nancy Cunard."

FEMGEN 137:,Beauty and Power,"Beauty functions as a form of currency that can grant access, privilege, and possibility. How do European beauty standards collude with patriarchal power to justify social inequalities? This class facilitates weekly discussions that focus on the social construction of beauty and its socio-political impact on people of all genders. We will chart the intersections of beauty and power in order to consider the colonial construction of racial and sexual hierarchies, the $445 billion beauty industry, and daily practices that subvert, queer, or decolonize beauty. With the goal of expanding our sense of what beauty is and does, we will mine feminist theory and popular culture for surprising commentary on topics including objectification, aging, celebrity, self-fashioning, and the politics of counter-aesthetics."

In this course, we will critically examine the idea of gender from a sociological perspective. For the first few weeks, we will tackle the big question 'What is gender?' To do this, we will begin by interrogating taken-for-granted ideas about the biological underpinnings of gender. We then dive into sociological conceptions of gender. In the latter portion of the course we will examine the ways gender operates and produces inequality within a variety of societal institutions, including the media, the family, the workplace, and the legal system. This class will expose you to some of the methods social scientists use to study gender and help you think critically about common sense understandings of gender through a look at both popular journalism and rigorous academic research. The emphasis of this class is to leave you with a long-lasting understanding of why the study of social problems, and especially those related to gender, matter."

Twitter users quickly adopted the slogan, using the hashtag to celebrate everyday moments of beauty, accomplishment, and magic. The slogan offered a contemporary iteration of an historical alignment: namely, the concept of ""magic"" with both Black people as well as ""blackness."" This course explores the legacy of Black magic--and black magic--through performance texts including plays, poetry, films, and novels. We will investigate the creation of magical worlds, the discursive alignment of magic with blackness, and the contemporary manifestation of a historical phenomenon.

We begin with healthy women and explore ideas about women's life cycle in the past, including women's sexuality, the history of birth control, abortion, childbirth, and aging. We then turn to the history of women healers including midwives, lay physicians, professional physicians and nurses. Finally, we examine women's illnesses and their treatment as well as the lives of women with disabilities in the past.

This course examines his classic novels and essays as well his exciting work across many lesser-examined domains - poetry, music, theatre, sermon, photo-text, children's literature, public media, comedy and artistic collaboration. Placing his work in context with other writers of the 20C (Faulkner, Wright, Morrison) and capitalizing on a resurgence of interest in the writer (NYC just dedicated a year of celebration of Baldwin and there are 2 new journals dedicated to study of Baldwin), the course seeks to capture the power and influence of Baldwin's work during the Civil Rights era as well as his relevance in the ""post-race"" transnational 21st century, when his prescient questioning of the boundaries of race, sex, love, leadership and country assume new urgency."

A brief look through today's media sources exposes a wide range of racialized and gendered representations of the Middle East that shape the way the world imagines the Middle East to be. As postcolonial theorist Edward Said explains, the framework we call Orientalism establishes the ontological character of the Orient and the Oriental as inherently `Other'.

Through theoretical and historical texts and viewing live and recorded dance, we will develop tools for analyzing dance and understanding its place in social, cultural, and political structures. This uses dance and choreography as a lens to more deeply understand a wide range of identity and cultural formations, such as gender, race, sexuality, (dis)ability, (trans)nationality, and empire. We will analyze dancing bodies that move across stages, dance clubs, film screens, and border zones. We will examine dance from diverse locales and time periods including ballet, modern and contemporary dance, contact improvisation, folkloric dance, burlesque, street dance, queer club dance, drag performance, music videos, TV dance competitions, and intermedia/new media performance. In addition to providing theoretical and methodological grounding in dance studies, this course develops performance analysis skills and hones the ability to write critically and skillfully about dance. No previous experience in dance is necessary to successfully complete the course."

But what does intersectionality mean? What can intersectionality offer And what does it mean for research and social movements to be truly intersectional? The aim of this course is to provide students with an understanding of the concept of intersectionality. First, we will delve into the works (chiefly from Black feminist scholars) that provide the foundation for today's concept of intersectionality. We will then explore, compare, and critique sociological research that applies (or fails to apply) an intersectional lens to its objects of study. Finally, we will investigate the use of intersectionality in social movements and outside academia. Throughout the course, we will prioritize reading, evaluating, and questioning sociological theory and research."

This course provides an introduction to feminist philosophy by exploring how important theoretical questions around sex and gender bear on practical ethical and political debates. The first part of the course will examine some of the broader theoretical questions in feminist philosophy, including: the metaphysics of gender, the demands of intersectionality, and feminist critiques of capitalism and liberalism. Questions will include: How should we understand the category `woman¿? How does gender intersect with other axes of oppression? Is capitalism inherently patriarchal?

Starting with problematizing the fixed notions of gender and sexuality, we map the attitudes toward these notions through visiting a diverse array of sources from the Qur¿an, Sunna, and legal documents to historical and anthropological case studies, literature, and film from South East Asia to Europe and North America. We examine the notions of femininity and masculinity in the Qur¿an, family laws, and attitudes toward homosexuality and transgendered populations. We read examples of ambiguous use of language with regards to gender and sexuality in Persian poetry and mystical traditions. We study the dynamic relationship between Islam and Feminism in the Muslim world. Finally, we witness the implications of these attitudes in our case studies and stories, from a divorce court in Iran to a wedding in Sudan."

Simply put, men's sports are more popular than women's--so much so, in fact, that people often make the hierarchical distinction between ""sports"" and ""women's sports."" But what would it take to get more women's sports featured on ESPN or more female athletes on the cover of Sports Illustrated? And, given the well-documented corruption at the highest levels of men's sports, should such an ascent in popularity be the goal for women's sports? This course will map out and respond to the multifaceted issues that emerge when women enter the sports world.

Without Queer Theory, few of the discourses around desire, power and gender identity that we take for granted on college campuses today would exist. Yet there is also a real risk that reality has left the theory behind. In this course, we will try to answer the question: What do we need queer theory for? Do we still need it?

FILMEDIA 100B:,History of World Cinema II: The Films of Ernst Lubitsch (FILMEDIA 300B),"Provides an overview of cinema made around the world between 1930 and 1960, highlighting technical, cultural, political, and economic forces that shaped mid-twentieth-century cinema. We study key film movements and national cinemas towards developing a formal, historical, and theoretical appreciation of a variety of commercial and art film traditions. Specific topics may vary by term/year/instructor. This term's topic: Ernst Lubitsch was: a stage actor in Berlin; a comic actor in early German cinema; Germany's most profitable director in the early 1920s; a director of subtle silent comedies in Hollywood in the later `20s; an innovative director of sound musicals and comedies in the 1930s; head of production for Paramount Pictures; and one of the few directors whose name and likeness were familiar to audiences across America, one famed for what became known as The Lubitsch Touch. The course considers Lubitsch in all these contexts. Charts intersections with collaborators, genre conventions, sexuality and censorship, and studio control. Lubitsch's style depends on performance, so attention will be given to film acting as he came to shape it."

And how are these media themselves involved in environmental change? In this course, we look at media and the environment as interlocking parts of a system, inseparable from one another. We might start by asking how, for example, documentary and narrative films portray environmental crises like oil spills, wildfires, or extinction events. From there, however, we will need to investigate the ways that media themselves constitute environments, both metaphorically and literally. We swim in media; it is the air we breathe.

FILMEDIA 223:,How to Watch TV,"'How to watch TV' may seem like the most obvious thing in the world. Yet when we look at the historical development of television as a technological, social, and cultural form, we find that people have engaged with it in a variety of different ways. There is not, in other words, a single right way to watch TV. This is because television itself has undergone transformations on all of these levels: Technologically, changes such as those from black-and-white to color, analog to digital, standard to high-definition, and broadcast to cable to interactive all play a role in changing our relation to what 'television' is. Socially, changes in television¿s integration in corporate and industrial structures, its mediation of political realities, and its ability to reflect and shape our interactions with one another all play a role in transforming who 'we' as viewers are. And culturally, varieties of programming including live broadcasting, prerecorded content, and on-demand streaming of news, movies, sit-coms, and prestige dramas series all indicate differences and distinctions in what it means to 'watch' TV. In this course, we will engage with these and other aspects of television as a medium in order to rethink not only how but why we watch TV."

The dancing body, the comic body, dead and live bodies, the monstrous body, the body in pain, the virtual body all raise questions about embodiment, liveness, and performance. We will read the body in audiovisual culture through an engagement with affect theory, focusing on the labor of performance, the construction of stardom, spatial and temporal configurations of the performing body, and the production of affect and sensation in the spectating body. Through a discussion of make-up, fashion, the labor of producing the idealized star body from the meat-and-bones body of the actor, or body genres where the spectator's body is beside itself with sexual pleasure, fear and terror, or overpowering sadness, we will inquire into ideologies of discipline and desire that undergird mediatized bodies more »"
FILMPROD 101:,Screen Writing I: Visual Writing,"A writing workshop that is an exploration of visual storytelling. Beginning with visual literacy, the class progresses from basic cinematic techniques through scene exercises to revisions and ultimately to connecting scenes in order to build sequences of script pages.

Students will use the conceptual framework of experimental cinema and documentary film to inform their work, while also pushing toward a new artistic language in the still-emerging form of VR storytelling. Over the course of the quarter, students will work in teams to create a series of short immersive pieces with an emphasis on experimentation. The class has no prerequisites and is open to all students."
FINANCE 211:,"Corporate Finance: Applications, Techniques, and Models","This course will develop and apply the basic tools and models of corporate finance to real-world corporate decisions. This course is designed to be the second course in the standard finance sequence; that is, it is designed to be the natural follow-up to the Fall Finance course. This course will develop and extend standard tools and techniques of financial analysis, valuation, and model-building, and apply these methods to a wide range of cases. Case topics will include mergers and acquisitions, private equity, corporate governance, capital structure, agency conflicts, and corporate restructuring. For all of these applications, this course will emphasize the central importance of financial analysis, valuation, and modeling to guiding optimal decision making."
FINANCE 305:,Capital Markets and Institutional Investing,"This course takes a look at institutional investing from the asset owner or limited partner¿s perspective (sovereign wealth funds, endowments, pension funds, life insurance companies, etc.) The course is co-taught by Ana Marshall, the CIO of the Hewlett Foundation, and Hanno Lustig, who was on the Allocation Advisory Board of the NBIM. We cover the tools of modern asset allocation and manager selection with a special focus on the challenges posed by alternative asset classes (hedge funds and private equity). To provide additional context, Ana Marshall will lecture on best practices in asset allocation and manager selection. Scott Gladstone, the developer of the Aladdin asset management tool at Blackrock, will introduce the class to this new tool. Students enrolled in the course will get access to Aladdin. The course material is founded on insights from modern finance and the economics of delegated asset management, complemented by industry perspectives. The target audience for this course includes all students who are interested in careers or already have careers in asset management. The course objective is to help you develop an understanding of the main challenges in the asset allocation and manager selection process, and hand you the tools to navigate these challenges."
FINANCE 362:,Financial Trading Strategies,"The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with the different types of trading strategies employed by hedge funds. Throughout the sessions, students will be challenged to understand and explore the application and implementation of these different strategies. Trading simulations employed on the Rotman Interactive Trader will be used extensively in this course as a way to learn and test different strategies. All classes will be held in the Real-time Analytics and Investment Lab (RAIL), located on the third floor of the Bass Building (B312). Students are expected to attend all sessions. Grades are based on in-class simulation results, class participation, and two written assignments."
FINANCE 373:,Entrepreneurial Finance,"This is a course about the financial decision-making process largely from the point of view of the CEO of an entrepreneurial venture, ranging from very early to very late stages. The course takes a two-pronged approach: First, we develop tools and concepts of corporate finance related to modeling, valuation, control, and investment decisions within an entrepreneurial context. Second, we use cases with firms at different stages of their life cycles from initial angel or venture capital investments through exit decisions, in order to see the issues that arise when these principles are applied in practice. In some cases we show the viewpoint of the entrepreneur and in others the perspective of the investor. After all, as an entrepreneur, one cannot negotiate effectively without understanding an investor's motivations. Conversely, an investor cannot evaluate a potential investment opportunity without appreciating the entrepreneur's perspective and incentives. Finally, we explore new developments in entrepreneurial finance such as crowdfunding and early liquidity provisions."
FINANCE 385:,Angel and Venture Capital Financing for Entrepreneurs and Investors,"This course covers all the stages of funding for early stage high-growth companies, from seed funding to venture capital rounds to a successful exit. We will concentrate on how entrepreneurs and investors make and should make important decisions. Examples of issues that we will cover are: How can entrepreneurs raise funding successfully? What are typical mistakes entrepreneurs make in raising capital and negotiating with investors? How to choose your investor? How to pitch to an investor? How do angels and VCs generate and process their deal flow and select companies? How are VCs involved in business decisions such as recruiting talent and replacing CEOs? What are the important provisions of financial contracts between VCs and founders? How to value early-stage companies? The course is very applied and mostly case-based. We will discuss a lot of nitty-gritty details that is a must for founders and investors. Case protagonists, founders, angels, and VCs will be among guest speakers. No prior knowledge of the VC industry is needed."
FINANCE 587:,Private Equity - An Overview of the Industry,"This 2-unit elective at the GSB is an ""Overview"" of the private equity industry including its reason for being, its growth and the various strategies for success that private equity firms employ. The course looks at all aspects of private equity partnerships and private equity investing. The course may be of particular interest to five groups of students: (i) students who aspire to be employed in private equity as a career; (ii) students who plan to be employed by companies that are owned by private equity firms; (iii) students who may invest in private equity partnerships as a limited partner; (iv) students who find private equity to be an interesting part of the financial services industry, and (v) students who expect to participate in corporate business development or mergers and acquisitions. The course will meet for nine classes. Each class will have at least one senior partner from a private equity firm to comment on the activities of his firm. In years past, some of the true leaders of the industry have participated. One class will be a mock investment review committee presentation as a final project."

FRENCH 87N:,The New Wave: How The French Reinvented Cinema,"When the French New Wave burst onto the stage in 1959, it changed forever the way films are made and the ways we think about cinema. Shooting on location with small crews, light cameras, unknown actors and improvised scripts, a group of young film critics turned filmmakers circumvented the big studios to craft low-budget films that felt fresh, irreverent and utterly modern. In just a few years, the Nouvelle Vague delivered such landmark works as Truffaut's 400 Blows, Godard's Breathless or Resnais' Hiroshima mon amour. Together with Agnès Varda, Eric Rohmer and Claude Chabrol, they redefined the essence of cinema as an art form as complex and multi-layered as literature. Yet, after having been hailed as revolutionary, the Nouvelle Vague was soon dismissed as 'rather vague and not all that new.'nnWhy did these films look so radically fresh? What is their common aesthetics, when each 'auteur' claimed an utterly personal style for him or herself? And what did their immediate success and e more »"
FRENCH 130:,Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance French Literature,"In this introductory course, we will read some key texts of literature written in French between 1100 and 1600, paying special attention to how gender, cultural difference and love played a role in the doing and undoing of communities. What does it mean to be a woman writer when most things were written by men? What does it mean to be a man, at court or at war? What did people learn when traveling to Asia or to the New Continent, and how did it impact the way people conceived of ethnicity? How did people think of ethnic difference in their midst? How can love strengthen an empire, and how can one be sincere when copying a love-poem? These cultural questions will be answered with special attention to literary form. Different genres might have yielded different possibilities to not just represent, but also imagine ways of living together; perhaps the very structure of a sentence allows one to construe one's own identity.

We will study texts in all major genres (prose, poetry, theater, film) related to movements such as Romanticism, Realism, Naturalism, Surrealism, Theater of the Absurd, and the Nouveau Roman. We will regularly relate literature and film to developments in other arts, such as painting and music.

Why do we believe that love is above all a visual force? How is pleasure, even erotic pleasure, achieved through looking? While the psychology of impressions offers some answers, this course uncovers the ways poets, songwriters, and especially artists have explored myths and promoted ideas about the coupling of love and seeing. Week by week, we will be reflecting on love as political critique, social disruption, and magical force. And we will do so by examining some of the most iconic works of art, from Dante's writings on lovesickness to Caravaggio's Narcissus, studying the ways that objects have shifted from keepsakes to targets of our cares. While exploring the visual roots and evolutions of what has become one of life's fundamental drives, this course offers a passionate survey of European art from Giotto's kiss to Fragonard's swing that elicits stimulating questions about the sensorial nature of desire and the human struggle to control emotions."

How can we live in a highly imperfect world? And what can film do that other media can't? We'll think about all of these great questions with the help of films that are philosophically stimulating, stylistically intriguing, and, for the most part, gripping to watch: Do The Right Thing (Lee), The Dark Knight (Nolan), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Kaufman), Arrival (Villeneuve), My Dinner with André (Malle), Blade Runner (Scott), La Jetée (Marker), Fight Club (Fincher), No Country for Old Men (Coen), The Seventh Seal (Bergman), and Memento (Nolan).

What did Haiti symbolize for the African diaspora and the Americas at large? What sources and methods do scholars use to understand this history? To answer these questions, this course covers the Haitian story from colonization to independence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Our course will center Africans and people of African descent, both enslaved and free, as they negotiated and resisted systems of racial and economic oppression in the French Caribbean. Our inquiry will critically engage with conceptions and articulations of human and civil rights as they relate to legal realities and revolutionary change over time, as well as the interplay between rights and racial thinking. Tracing what historian Julius Scott called the ""common wind"" of the Haitian Revolution, we will also investigate how the new nation's emergence built on the American and French Revolutions while also influencing national independence movements elsewhere in the Atlantic World.

Some parts of the human body visibly age like hair and skin, others are less visible like our kidneys, liver and heart. What is the trajectory of aging for each of these organs and how can the aging of these organs be measured quantitatively? We will go through parts of the human body and study the genetics and mechanisms of aging for each, and discuss if there are preventative and interventional measures that can be undertaken. As part of this course students test an interventional measure on themselves."

GERMAN 60N:,German Crime,"Crime is as old as humanity, as old as storytelling. Cain's murder of Abel, Antigone's burial of Polynices, Robin Hood's robbing from the rich: all of these testify to the ongoing fascination with crime and criminality, and to literature's role in policing, and probing, the boundaries of social legitimacy. This is a course about murders, break-ins, betrayals, sexual infidelity and violence, and crimes against humanity, and the ways those crimes, sometimes moral, sometimes legal, and sometimes not really even exactly criminal, teach us about German and German literature in recent centuries. Course material will include modern and classical crime fiction (Friedrich Glauser, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Jakob Arjouni, Thomas Glavinic), crime in novelistic, theatrical and poetic genres (Anna Seghers, Bertolt Brecht, Heinrich von Kleist, Friedrich Schiller), and German-language television and film (Fritz Lang's ""M,""Carol Reed's ""The Third Man,"" ""Tatort""). nThis course is for students with good knowledge of German.

Taught in English; students of all backgrounds are very welcome."
GERMAN 130A:,A History of German Opera,"When we think of opera, and perhaps especially German opera, a list of stereotypes immediately springs to mind: tenors who refuse to die, horned helmets and blond braids, an artform so elite that it has lost all relevance in the contemporary world. While not discounting those images, this course will position opera at the center of Germany's historical and cultural development over the past three centuries - from early discussions about the country's place between the more culturally hegemonic Italy and France, to its struggle for unification in the 19th century, to the Third Reich's co-opting of all 'German' forms of expression to serve its ends. We will discuss German opera's link to movements like Romanticism and Expressionism, and to philosophers like Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. Along the way, we will learn how to listen to and talk about this very strange genre, and gain fluency in a range of musical styles and periods. No musical expertise required; taught in German. Prerequisite: GERLANG 21 or instructor permission."
GERMAN 141:,The Magic Mountain: Your Travel Guide to a Great Novel,"In this course, students will read their way through one of the great German novels, Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain (Der Zauberberg, 1924) an epic stock-taking of European thought and sensibility between the world wars.

GERMAN 149:,Babylon Berlin,"Berlin, 1929. A police inspector and his unlikely partner, a typist and aspiring homicide detective, turn up the case of a lifetime: a far-reaching political conspiracy in the capital of a democracy on the edge. Part noir detective thriller, part historical drama, the blockbuster German television series Babylon Berlin (2017) will serve as our springboard to understand the culture, politics, and society of the Weimar Republic (1918,1933), a fifteen-year experiment in democracy that preceded the rise of the Third Reich. From corruption and criminality to sociopolitical upheaval and a remarkable arts scene: Berlin of the Roaring Twenties, a study in contrasts and conflicts, had it all. Does the Netflix hit harbor, almost eerie parallels to the present, as one German newspaper recently suggested? Weekly viewings of the complete seasons one and two will be accompanied by close study of the era's literature, cinema, and visual arts.

GERMAN 185:,Understanding International Politics Today: From the German Philosophers to Modern Social Science,"This course is being offered in collaboration with Stanford in Berlin, Bing Overseas Study Program. International politics is beset by problems. States go to war. The global economy is volatile and unequal. The human community is divided into multiple nation-states. Some states dominate others. People commit acts of evil. Luckily, we are not the first people to have noticed that international politics is not characterized exclusively by peace and harmony. War, capitalism, racism, and totalitarianism have all been subjects about which German thinkers - many based in Berlin - have made profound contributions over the last two centuries. Do their ideas and arguments stand up in the cold light of modern social science? What can we learn from them - and what do we need to discard? This course will introduce students to perennial problems in international politics from two perspectives: those of key German political thinkers, and those of modern social science. It is structured around five c more »"

The grail - a mysterious vessel with supernatural properties - is first mentioned in Chrétien de Troyes' ""Perceval,"" but the story is soon rewritten by authors who alter the meaning of both the grail and the quest. By reading three different versions, we will explore how they respond differently to major topics in medieval culture and relevant to today: romantic love, family ties, education, moral guilt, and spiritual practice.

GERMAN 237:,Fascism after Fascism (COMPLIT 237),"When World War II ended, most of the states that described themselves as ""fascist"" ended with it. Nevertheless, fascism haunted postwar democracy as an ever-present threat. The question of what exactly had characterized fascism, and what parts of it persisted within liberal democracies themselves, were continuously and contentiously debated. This question has emerged all the more forcefully in recent years as ""illiberal,"" or ""right-wing populist,"" movements and governments have begun to question the basic premises of liberal democracy. What was fascism, and what would it mean for it to return? This course considers writings by philosophers, historians, journalists and writers, and moves from early anti-fascist writings to critiques of online movements and neo-reactionaries."
GERMAN 280:,"Feminist Avant-Garde Art in Germany and Beyond (1968-2019) (ARTHIST 272, ARTHIST 472, FEMGEN 280)","In ""Woman's Art: A Manifesto"" (1972), the artist, performer and filmmaker Valie Export (1940) proposed the transfer of women's experience into an art context and considered the body ""a signal bearer of meaning and communication."" In reconceptualizing and displaying ""the"" body (her body) as an aesthetic sign, Export's groundbreaking work paves the way towards questioning the concepts of a ""female aesthetic"" and a ""male gaze"" (L. Mulvey). Beginning with Export, we will discuss art informed by and coalescing with feminism(s): the recent revival of the 1970s in all-women group shows, the dialectic of feminist revolution, the breakdown of stable identities and their representations, point(s) of absorption of commodified femininities. Particular attention will be paid to German-language theory and its medial transfer into art works. For students of German Studies, readings and discussions in German are possible. Online discussions will be organized with contemporary artists and curators. Emp more »"

This once-a-week seminar offers a line-up of hands-on sessions with seasoned guests from across Stanford. Each session introduces students to a different cultural perspective via expert insight and activities that encourage learning by doing: faculty- and student-led workshops will encompass multiple media (such as music, dance, visual arts), genres (such as pop culture, drama, folklore, and poetry), and venues that are global in nature (such as sports and technology).

GLOBAL 249B:,Iranian Cinema in Diaspora (COMPLIT 249B),"Despite enormous obstacles, immigrant Iranian filmmakers, within a few decades (after the Iranian Revolution), have created a slow but steady stream of films outside Iran. They were originally started by individual spontaneous attempts from different corners of the world and by now we can identify common lines of interest amongst them. There are also major differences between them. These films have never been allowed to be screened inside Iran, and without any support from the global system of production and distribution, as independent and individual attempts, they have enjoyed little attention. Despite all this, Iranian cinema in exile is in no sense any less important than Iranian cinema inside Iran. In this course we will view one such film, made outside Iran, in each class meeting and expect to reach a common consensus in identifying the general patterns within these works and this movement. Questions such as the ones listed below will be addressed in our meetings each week: What more »"
GLOBAL 249C:,Contemporary Iranian Theater (COMPLIT 249C),"Today, Iranian plays both in traditional and contemporary styles are staged in theater festivals throughout the world and play their role in forming a universal language of theater which combine the heritages from countries in all five continents. Despite many obstacles, some Iranian plays have been translated into English and some prominent Iranian figures are successful stage directors outside Iran. Forty-six years ago when ""Theater in Iran"" (a monograph on the history of Iranian plays) by Bahram Beyzaie was first published, it put the then contemporary Iranian theater movement ""which was altogether westernizing itself blindly"" face to face with a new kind of self-awareness. Hence, today's generation of playwrights and stage directors in Iran, all know something of their theatrical heritage. In this course we will spend some class sessions on the history of theater in Iran and some class meetings will be concentrating on contemporary movements and present day playwrights.

GSBGEN 333:,Technology Licensing: Strategy and Negotiation,"Licensing of technology and its corresponding intellectual property is big business, and integral to the business plans and competitive strategies of start-ups and Fortune 500 companies alike. Because licenses are complex agreements with important legal consequences, it is tempting for business executives to delegate to lawyers the negotiation of the 'non-economic terms' of their companies' technology license agreements. The problem with such an approach, however, is that at their core, issues of license structure, scope and risk require business judgments, and not merely legal ones. Do we need exclusive rights, and if so, to what, where and for how long? Will this prospective licensee bring our technology to market, and how do we mitigate the risk that it fails to do so? Can this licensor support our development efforts, and will it stand behind its IP in the event of a problem? Do we expose the guts of our technology to the world and try to protect it with patents, or do we keep it c more »"
GSBGEN 341:,"Climate Change, Economics, Technology","This course covers (1) the causes and consequences of climate change, (2) the predicted economic impacts, policy modeling, and ethical concerns, and (3) the technological pathways that the world is likely to follow. The first part focuses on both basics and common misunderstandings. This includes the role of income growth, population growth, regional growth, efficiency growth, and poverty. The second part begins with integrated assessment models and reasons for disagreement among prominent models. (Students are expected to understand public goods dilemmas and free-riding.) It then proceeds to an obvious but often overlooked basic and essential fact: these models upon which all activist and government actions are based are unrealistic academic exercises. They are not even asking the right questions. Thus, United Nations treaties and carbon footprint initiatives are distractions rather than solutions. The third part discusses where clean and other technology is as of 2022 and what it wil more »"
GSBGEN 345:,Disruptions in Education,"The recent pandemic disrupted higher education significantly, surfacing novel needs, while at the same putting decades long trends into sharper focus.

GSBGEN 538:,Power in Finance,"There is a growing sense that both capitalism and democracy are in crisis. Is the focus on financial metrics and markets to blame for the eroding trust in corporations and governments? How do power dynamics shape the financial system and determine economic and political outcomes?

GSBGEN 565:,Political Communication: How Leaders Become Leaders,"This year -- 2022 -- will be a fascinating backdrop for national as well as state and local politics. Implications of the recent pandemic, its dramatic economic impacts and an uneven but recovering economy, Inflation fears, a war in Ukraine, and looming off-year elections in the U.S. will continue to complicate the political landscape Politics, perhaps like no other arena, provides a rich and dramatic laboratory for studying the art and science of influential communication. Whether it is a local school bond election or a Congressional race, a Presidential debate or a State of the Union Address, the demanding communications of politics provide insights into our own strengths and gaps as a communicator and leader. Political campaigns, by their very nature, are highly visible, oriented toward very specific objectives, and increasingly leverage a variety of new media platforms. They are often emotionally charged, and rife with conflict and drama. The principles of political communications more »"

GSBGEN 596:,Designing AI to Cultivate Human Well-Being,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to drive us towards a better future for all of humanity, but it also comes with significant risks and challenges. At its best, AI can help humans mitigate climate change, diagnose and treat diseases more effectively, enhance learning, and improve access to capital throughout the world. But it also has the potential to exacerbate human biases, destroy trust in information flow, displace entire industries, and amplify inequality throughout the world. We have arrived at a pivotal moment in the development of the technology in which we must establish a foundation for how we will design AI to capture the positive potential and mitigate the negative risks. To do this, we must be intentional about human-centered design because, ¿Only once we have thought hard about what sort of future we want, will we be able to begin steering a course toward a desirable future. If we don¿t know what we want, we¿re unlikely to get it.¿ Thus, building AI must be a more »"

We plan to visit with local water managers, farmers, ranchers, loggers, Native American fishermen, and energy administrators, as well as elected officials and environmental activists, to examine the hydrologic, meteorologic, and geologic bases of the River's water and energy resources, and the practical, social, environmental, economic, and political issues surrounding their development in the Pacific No more »"
HISTORY 35:,"Sustainability and Civilization (BIO 35, POLISCI 35)","Our civilization faces multiple sustainability challenges. Climate change often dominates public conversation, but in fact, a whole range of environmental, economic, political, and cultural trends threaten the structures that sustain the societies we know. These problems cannot be understood in isolation, because they interact in complex ways. Solving them will require collaboration across many different fields, from the natural and social sciences to the humanities. This one-unit course brings together over two dozen faculty from across the entire university for a series of interdisciplinary conversations around cross-cutting themes. Our aim is to encourage dialogue and perhaps even future collaborations among students and professors who might otherwise rarely interact in a classroom. All students are welcome, but frosh and sophomores may find the course especially useful as an introduction to a wide range of sustainability-related disciplines and teachers at Stanford."
HISTORY 38S:,All That Glitters is not Gold: The Country House in Modern Britain,"The country house is more than just the setting for period dramas starring Maggie Smith; its story, from construction to demolition, is also that of modern Britain. This class is a biography of the country house, told each week as a chapter of historical methodology. From palace to military hospital to 'heritage' property of the National Trust, we will use the country house--its occupants, decor, and collections--to see how this symbol of class hierarchy came to be a national rallying point for Brexiteers."
HISTORY 39Q:,"Were They Really ""Hard Times""? Mid-Victorian Social Movements and Charles Dickens (ENGLISH 39Q)","""It was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it."" So begins Charles Dickens description of Coketown in Hard Times. And it only seems to get more grim from there. But the world that Dickens sought to portray in the novel was a hopeful one, too. And that tension is our starting point. The intent of this class is to more closely examine mid-Victorian Britain in light of Dickens' novel, with particular focus on the rise of some of our modern social movements in the 19th century. While things like the labor movement, abolitionism, feminism, and environmentalism, are not the same now as they were then, this class will explore the argument that the 21st century is still, in some ways, working out 19th century problems and questions. At the same time, this is also a course that seeks to expand the kinds of sources we traditionally use as historians. Thus, while recognizing that literary sources are particularly complex, we will use Hard T more »"

HISTORY 69Q:,American Road Trips (AMSTUD 109Q),"""Nothing behind me, everything ahead of me, as is ever so on the road."" --Jack Kerouac, On the Road, 1957. From Jack Kerouac's On the Road to Cheryl Strayed's Wild, this course explores epic road trips of the twentieth century. Travel is a fundamental social and cultural practice through which Americans have constructed ideas about the self, the nation, the past, and the future. The open road, as it is often called, offered excitement, great adventure, and the space for family bonding and memory making. But the footloose and fancy-free nature of travel that Jack Kerouac celebrated was available to some travelers but not to all. Engaging historical and literary texts, film, autobiography, memoir, photography, and music, we will consider the ways that travel and road trips have been represented in American culture. This course examines the following questions: How did men and women experience travel differently? How did the motivations for travel change over time? What role did race, ethnicity, class, relationships, and sexuality play in these trips? Students will work together to plan a road trip of their own which the class will take during the quarter."

What did Haiti symbolize for the African diaspora and the Americas at large? What sources and methods do scholars use to understand this history? To answer these questions, this course covers the Haitian story from colonization to independence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Our course will center Africans and people of African descent, both enslaved and free, as they negotiated and resisted systems of racial and economic oppression in the French Caribbean. Our inquiry will critically engage with conceptions and articulations of human and civil rights as they relate to legal realities and revolutionary change over time, as well as the interplay between rights and racial thinking. Tracing what historian Julius Scott called the ""common wind"" of the Haitian Revolution, we will also investigate how the new nation's emergence built on the American and French Revolutions while also influencing national independence movements elsewhere in the Atlantic World. Priority given to history majors and minors; no prerequisites and all readings are in English."

HISTORY 114:,Origins of History in Greece and Rome (CLASSICS 88),"What's the history of `History'? The first ancient historians wrote about commoners and kings, conquest and power - those who had it, those who wanted it, those without it. Their powerful ways of recounting the past still resonate today and can be harnessed to tell new stories. We will look at how ancients like Herodotus, Thucydides, Tacitus, and Livy turned stories about the past into compelling narratives of loss, growth and decline - inventing 'History' as we know it.

This course focuses on the political and spiritual lives of Martin and Malcolm. We will examine their personal biographies, speeches, writings, representations, FBI Files, and legacies as a way to better understand how the intersections of religion, race, and politics came to bare upon the freedom struggles of people of color in the US and abroad.

HISTORY 200K:,Doing Literary History: Orwell in the World (ENGLISH 224),"This course will bring together the disciplines of history and literary studies by looking closely at the work of one major twentieth-century author: the British writer and political polemicist George Orwell. In 1946, Orwell writes, ""What I have most wanted to do throughout the past ten years is to make political writing into an art."" In these years, Orwell writes about-- and often participates in or witnesses first-hand--a series of major events and crises. These include British imperialism in Burma, urban poverty in Europe, class inequality in England, the conflict between Socialism and Fascism in Spain, and the rise of totalitarianism in the Soviet Union. In engaging all of these events, Orwell experiments with different literary forms, moving between fiction and non-fiction, novel and autobiography, essay and memoir, manifesto and fable, literature and journalism. Few writers demand such sustained and equal attention to text and context: in this course we will move back-and-forth between Orwell's varied writing and the urgent social and political contexts it addresses."

This course explores ethical pathways in European, Islamic, and East Asian traditions: mysticism and rationality, passion and duty, this and other worldly, ambition and peace of mind. They all seem to be pairs of opposites, but as we'll see, some important historical figures managed to follow two or more of them at once. We will read works by successful thinkers, travelers, poets, lovers, and bureaucrats written between 800 and 1900 C.E. We will ask ourselves whether we agree with their choices and judgments about what is a life well lived."
HISTORY 212D:,Dante's World: A Medieval and Renaissance Journey,"700 years ago this year Dante Alighieri died. The Italian poet, philosopher, politician, and humanist crafted one of the great epics of world literature, The Divine Comedy. For seven centuries, his journey through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven has been a source of inspiration and fascination for countless artists, critics, and students from all over the world. Yet, at heart, his tale is a commentary upon the complex, violent, wealthy, and deeply religious world to which Dante belonged. In this class, we will investigate Dante's world. Medieval Italy held a privileged place in Latin Christendom. Its location upon a peninsula, jutting out into the Mediterranean Sea, meant it was wedged between and deeply affected by the Islamic and Byzantine worlds. It was home to merchants, bankers, nobles, university students, friars, nuns, and heretics, popes, prostitutes, and the city-states in which they all lived together.

HISTORY 223F:,Russia's Industrial Revolutions: The Making and Breaking of a Superpower,"In the span of a single century, Russia went from unstable empire to revolutionary proving ground, from scene of mass starvation to space pioneer, from the geopolitical sidelines to a seat among superpowers -- all before falling back again. This course foregrounds industrialization, economic development, and (often agonizing) adaptation as engines of these dramatic transformations. Was pre-revolutionary Russia 'backwards' as many suggested? Can state socialism be credited for decades of rapid growth and the landmark achievements of the USSR? Or should it be blamed for economic stagnation, environmental degradation, and the ultimate collapse of an empire? How have the conditions of that late 20th-century collapse impacted the country's prospects and problems into the 21st? Readings and assignments will encourage students to explore various methodological approaches -- social, cultural, economic, urban -- to address long-term themes and sector-specific histories of Russian industrialization.

East Europe and Russia in the First World War (HISTORY 327D, REES 227, REES 327)","Until recently history has been comparatively quiet about the experience of World War I in the east. Far from being a peripheral theater of war, however, the experiences of war on the Eastern Front were central to shaping the 20th century. Not only was the first shot of the war fired in the east, it was also the site of the most dramatic political revolution. Using scholarly texts, literature and film, this course combines political, military, cultural and social approaches to introduce the causes, conduct and consequences of World War I with a focus on the experiences of soldiers and civilians on the Eastern Front. Topics include: the war of movement, occupation, extreme violence against civilians, the Armenian genocide, population exchanges, the Russian Revolution and civil war, and the disintegration of empires and rise of nation-states."

What is power? What is human nature, and do all humans possess natural rights? How is human identity interwoven with the practice of power? What makes an idea radical? We will examine these and other questions through close readings of seven thinkers whose ideas shaped the modern period: John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Mary Wollstonecraft, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, C.L.R. James, and Michel Foucault."

Were the Americas a 'New World,' unknown to the ancients, entirely detached from the rest of human history? Even after the invasion and occupation of the Americas, many European chroniclers continued to think that the world was divided into three parts - Europe, Asia, and Africa. In their descriptions of the Americas, they drew heavily on histories and travel reports pertaining to other epochs and locales, especially contemporary Asia and ancient Rome. At the same time, indigenous elites and mestizo authors in the Americas used 'Old World' history and news of distant conflicts to reflect on the immediacy of their historical experience.

HISTORY 327D:,"All Quiet on the Eastern Front? East Europe and Russia in the First World War (HISTORY 227D, REES 227, REES 327)","Until recently history has been comparatively quiet about the experience of World War I in the east. Far from being a peripheral theater of war, however, the experiences of war on the Eastern Front were central to shaping the 20th century. Not only was the first shot of the war fired in the east, it was also the site of the most dramatic political revolution. Using scholarly texts, literature and film, this course combines political, military, cultural and social approaches to introduce the causes, conduct and consequences of World War I with a focus on the experiences of soldiers and civilians on the Eastern Front. Topics include: the war of movement, occupation, extreme violence against civilians, the Armenian genocide, population exchanges, the Russian Revolution and civil war, and the disintegration of empires and rise of nation-states."
HISTORY 336J:,A Tour of Dangerous Ideas: Radical Thinkers in Modern Europe (HISTORY 236J),"In this course we will examine ideas radical to their context in modern European thought, paying close attention to what it has meant to explain features of society, government, and politics in terms of power. What is power? What is human nature, and do all humans possess natural rights? How is human identity interwoven with the practice of power? What makes an idea radical? We will examine these and other questions through close readings of seven thinkers whose ideas shaped the modern period: John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Mary Wollstonecraft, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, C.L.R. James, and Michel Foucault."

(COMPLIT 251A, COMPLIT 351A, CSRE 251, CSRE 351, HISTORY 271C, ILAC 251, ILAC 351)","The conquerors, missionaries, and historians who reflected on Iberian overseas expansion during the early modern period often asked themselves a crucial question: was there only one world or many? Were the Americas a 'New World,' unknown to the ancients, entirely detached from the rest of human history? Even after the invasion and occupation of the Americas, many European chroniclers continued to think that the world was divided into three parts - Europe, Asia, and Africa. In their descriptions of the Americas, they drew heavily on histories and travel reports pertaining to other epochs and locales, especially contemporary Asia and ancient Rome. At the same time, indigenous elites and mestizo authors in the Americas used 'Old World' history and news of distant conflicts to reflect on the immediacy of their historical experience. In this course, students will consider the ways in which diverse authors in New Spain (Mexico), Peru, and Brazil contemplated themselves in relation to remote more »"

HUMBIO 128U:,Upstreaming Health (DESINST 258U),"Good health doesn't begin the minute someone walks into a doctor's office. If we want everyday life to become healthier by default, we need to shift our interventions from downstream to upstream, from healthcare to the places where we live, learn, work, and play. Upstreaming health means making a deliberate effort to create patterns of everyday life that keep people well - physically, emotionally, financially, and socially. In Upstreaming Health, we will explore systems that influence health, integrating concepts from public health, systems thinking, and design justice and use tools from product and policy design to answer the question: How might we upstream health for all people? Through three projects, students will prototype possibilities for upstreaming health for themselves, the Stanford community, and population as a whole, using food as a lens for designing systemic change.

HUMBIO 162L:,"The Literature of Psychosis (ANTHRO 82P, PSYC 82, PSYC 282)","One of the great gifts of literature is its ability to give us insight into the internal worlds of others. This is particularly true of that state clinicians call ""psychosis."" But psychosis is a complex concept. It can be terrifying and devastating for patients and families, and yet shares characteristics with other, less pathological states, such as mysticism and creativity. How then can we begin to make sense of it? In this course, we will examine the first-hand experience of psychosis. We will approach it from multiple perspectives, including clinical descriptions, works of art, and texts by writers ranging from Shakespeare, to the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, to patients attempting to describe their experience. This class is not only for students thinking of careers in medicine, psychology or anthropology, but also readers and writers interested exploring extraordinary texts. There are no prerequisites necessary; all that is needed is a love of language and a curiosity about the secrets of other minds."

HUMCORE 20:,"Humanities Core: Dao, Virtue, and Nature -- Foundations of East Asian Thought (CHINA 20, JAPAN 20, KOREA 20)","This course explores the values and questions posed in the formative period of East Asian civilizations. Notions of a Dao (""Way"") are common to Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism, but those systems of thought have radically different ideas about what that Dao is and how it might be realized in society and an individual's life. These systems of thought appeared first in China, and eventually spread to Korea and Japan. Each culture developed its own ways of reconciling the competing systems, but in each case the comprehensive structure of values and human ideals differs significantly from those that appeared elsewhere in the ancient world. The course examines East Asian ideas about self-cultivation, harmonious society, rulership, and the relation between human and nature with a view toward expanding our understanding of these issues in human history, and highlighting their legacies in Asian civilizations today.

HUMCORE 131:,Modernity and Novels in the Middle East (COMPLIT 43),"This course will investigate cultural and literary responses to modernity in the Middle East. The intense modernization process that started in mid 19th century and lingers to this day in the region caused Arabic, Persian, and Turkish literary cultures to encounter rapid changes; borders dissolved, new societies and nations were formed, daily life westernized, and new literary forms took over the former models. In order to understand how writers and individuals negotiated between tradition and modernity and how they adapted their traditions into the modern life we will read both canonical and graphic novels comparatively from each language group and focus on the themes of nation, identity, and gender. All readings will be in English translation. This course is part of the Humanities Core: https://humanitiescore.stanford.edu/"
HUMCORE 133:,"Humanities Core: How to be Modern in East Asia (CHINA 24, COMPLIT 44, JAPAN 24, KOREA 24)","Modern East Asia was almost continuously convulsed by war and revolution in the 19th and 20th centuries. But the everyday experience of modernity was structured more profoundly by the widening gulf between the country and the city, economically, politically, and culturally. This course examines literary and cinematic works from China and Japan that respond to and reflect on the city/country divide, framing it against issues of class, gender, national identity, and ethnicity. It also explores changing ideas about home/hometown, native soil, the folk, roots, migration, enlightenment, civilization, progress, modernization, nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and sustainability. All materials are in English. This course is part of the Humanities Core: https://humanitiescore.stanford.edu/"
HUMCORE 135:,Atlantic Folds: Indigeneity and Modernity (COMPLIT 46),"The Atlantic as an infinite doubling of ancient and modern. The Atlantic as an endless, watery cloth of African, American, and European folds, unfolding and refolding through bodies and ideas: blackness, whiteness, nature, nurture, water, blood, cannibal, mother, you, and I. The Atlantic as a concept, a space, a muse, a goddess. The Atlantic as birth and burial. One ocean under God, divisible, with salt enough for all who thirst.

HUMCORE 137:,Time Travel in the Americas,"Historical fiction refracts our view of the present and our hopes for the future through the prism of the past. This course explores twentieth and twenty-first century writing from the Americas that reflects back on the relationship between American identity, modernity, and colonial power. At the heart of all of these accounts is a reckoning with the nature of recorded history: who has had the power to speak for themselves, who has been represented by others, and who has been left out? For some writers, this entails the re-embodiment of real historical figures, whether Toussaint Louverture in CLR James's The Black Jacobins, Johann Moritz Rugendas in César Aira's An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter, or Estebánico in Laila Lalami's The Moor's Account. For others, it means the manufacture of plausible historical analogues, like Amabelle Désir in Edwidge Danticat's The Farming of Bones and Antoinette Rochester in Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea. And for some, like Rita Indiana in T more »"
HUMCORE 138:,Narrating the British Empire (HISTORY 238E),"In this course, we will read major British literary works of the age of empire to explore the relationship between imperialism and modern literature.

Here in California, we border this vast waterscape, which is larger than all the world's remaining oceans combined and which could easily fit all of the planet's landmasses within it. What lessons can we learn from the region's diverse and dynamic island cultures, its entangled histories, and its urgent contemporary issues? How has the Pacific impacted ideas about modernity elsewhere in the world? And what unique Oceanian modernities are emerging from the region? Engaging with a rich array of literary and performance texts, films, and artworks from the 19th to the 21st centuries, we will consider different ways in which the Pacific has been imagined. We will further explore how Pacific Islander scholars, artists, and activists have drawn on their cultural traditions and knowledge systems to create new works that respond to current challenges facing the region, including colonialism, globalization, tourism, migration, climate change, militarization, and nuclearization.

HUMRTS 101:,Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives on Human Rights Theory and Practice,"This course will introduce students to the philosophical and historical foundations for the modern concept of human rights, as well as the international and domestic legal frameworks currently in force to protect and promote these rights. Students will learn about the broad landscape of institutions responsible for defining and enforcing human rights from scholars who study the institutions, and practitioners who have worked inside them. Throughout the quarter we will read and discuss critical scholarship about the gap between the promises and aspirations of international human rights covenants, and the ongoing realities of widespread oppression, exploitation, and atrocity happening around the world. We will welcome practitioners as well as guest faculty from departments across the university whose teaching and research touches on aspects of human rights within their respective fields of expertise.

What did Haiti symbolize for the African diaspora and the Americas at large? What sources and methods do scholars use to understand this history? To answer these questions, this course covers the Haitian story from colonization to independence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Our course will center Africans and people of African descent, both enslaved and free, as they negotiated and resisted systems of racial and economic oppression in the French Caribbean. Our inquiry will critically engage with conceptions and articulations of human and civil rights as they relate to legal realities and revolutionary change over time, as well as the interplay between rights and racial thinking. Tracing what historian Julius Scott called the ""common wind"" of the Haitian Revolution, we will also investigate how the new nation's emergence built on the American and French Revolutions while also influencing national independence movements elsewhere in the Atlantic World.

Official historians, poets, and novelists imbued the ocean and the backlands with romanticism, yet these spaces were the backdrop to slavery and conquest. Instead of approaching shipwreck and captivity narratives as eyewitness testimonies, as many have, we will consider how they produced 'the sea' and 'the wilderness' as poetic constructions in Western literature while also offering glimpses of the 'darker side' of Iberian expansion.

INTLPOL 352:,State Building and the Rule of Law Seminar,"( LAW 5103) This Seminar is centrally concerned with bridging theory and practice. The seminar introduces the key theories relevant to state-building generally, and strengthening the rule of law in particular. This course explores the multidisciplinary nature of development --- through readings, lectures, guest lectures, case studies, and seminar discussions --- and asks how lawyers fit in and contribute to the process? The set of developing countries considered within the scope of this workshop is broad. It includes, among others, states engaged in post-conflict reconstruction, e.g., Cambodia, Timor Leste, Rwanda, Iraq, Sierra Leone; states still in conflict, e.g., Afghanistan, Somalia; the poorest states of the world that may not fall neatly into the categories of conflict or post-conflict, e.g., Nepal, Haiti; least developed states that are not marked by high levels of violent conflict at all, e.g., Bhutan; and more developed states at critical stages of transition, e.g., Tunisia, G more »"
INTLPOL 362:,"Data: Privacy, Property and Security","The collection, use and marketing of personal data are ubiquitous in the digital age. This seminar will explore the diverse legal regimes regulating personal data--including privacy, property and security--and the imperfect nature of their protections. Legal rules are rapidly evolving to address, if not resolve, the inevitable conflicts between privacy, property and security in relation to personal data. Laws have been enacted and new ones are under consideration at the national, state and even municipal levels, as well as around the world. Norms are emerging to guide these conflicts in the operation of business. Technology is evolving that can facilitate the protection, or accelerate the exploitation, of personal data. At the heart of all these developments is the question, who owns and controls personal data in the digital age. The same piece of data may in different hands raise different expectations. As an example, A may have a privacy expectation that her purchase from an online m more »"

INTNLREL 62Q:,Mass Atrocities: Reckoning and Reconciliation,"Imagine you live in a country in which a delusional dictator imprisons untold masses in labor and concentration camps, and kills millions of them. Imagine you live in another country, in which one ethnic group slaughters the other. Imagine you live in yet another country in which a racial white minority terrorizes and violently discriminates against a huge majority of black population. Or, imagine you live in a country in which members of one group engage in an ""ethnic cleansing"" of their former neighbors.Now imagine this: Some big political change comes to each of these societies, and the perpetrators lose their power and are finally stopped from committing any more crimes and atrocities. Now comes the time to decide how to bring about justice for the past wrongs. It is also a question of how to come to terms with the terrible past. How to remember it? How to confront it?

Do these organizations simply act on the interests of the governments that comprise them? Or do they have some autonomy to pursue their own programs, plans, and priorities? Does leadership of these organizations matter for their performance? What dilemmas do the leaders or intergovernmental organizations face as they try to satisfy governments while serving people in need all over the world? This course will get at these questions through examining the lives, careers and choices of leaders of major international organizations over the last thirty years. Reading assignments will include memoirs and biographies of leaders of international organizations, as well as analytical and empirical studies of international organizations. We plan on inviting former and current leaders of international organizations to visit the seminar."

This course explores the contradictions at the heart of Italy by examining how art and literature provide a unique perspective onto modern Italian history. We will focus on key phenomena that contribute both positively and negatively to the complex ""spirit"" of Italy, such as the presence of the past, political realism and idealism, revolution, corruption, decadence, war, immigration, and crises of all kinds.

ITALIAN 117:,Is Horror (also) Italian?,"Horror haunts our world. We associate it with manmade and natural catastrophes. But horror is also a genre. And haven't we all experienced something horrible? In this class, we take up the task of understanding what horror means, why it fascinates us, and to what extent it belongs to our lives. Our laboratory is perhaps an unexpected one: Italy. In the popular imagination, Italy is the land of fashion and Vespas, sunshine and romance: this class reveals its darker side. After finding the roots of Italian horror in Dante and Boccaccio's descriptions of Hell and the plague, we will then focus on horror in more recent Italian literature, comics, and cinema - covering supernatural sources, such as a haunted dance school, and horrifyingly real ones, such as the concentration camp. Centering on the Italian twentieth and twenty-first century, this class introduces students to a genre which is also, at the same time, an experience - and vice versa.

ITALIAN 127:,"Inventing Italian Literature: Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarca","This course is both an introduction to medieval Italian literature and culture and a continuation of the study of the Italian language. In the literary sphere the course will focus primarily on the Italian lyric tradition of the Sicilian school, the Dolce Stil Novo, and Dante's early lyric poetry. From there we will read and discuss Petrarch's Canzoniere and autobiographical letters. The third part of the course will regard the short story, or novella, in Boccaccio's Decameron and its antecedent, Il Novellino. The literary genres to be explored in this course are short-form poetry and prose (sonnets, madrigals, sestinas, canzoni, and the novella). Linguistically, the course will focus on the language of literary and cultural criticism - expressing and defending opinions at an advanced level, and discussing the themes of the course fluently. The expectation is that levels of reading, writing, and speaking will improve by the end of the quarter. All class discussion, reading, and writing will be in Italian."
ITALIAN 129:,Truth or Consequences: Introduction to Modern Italian Literature and Culture,"This course serves as an introduction to modern Italian literature and culture, while at the same time allowing students to further improve their understanding of Italian language. The guiding theme of our journey will be the Fantastic, a niche and often overlooked genre in the canon. Is the Fantastic a mere escape from reality and grim historical contingencies? Does it, perhaps, tell us more truth that it seems to concede? Through this notion, we will seek to analyze the different social, political, and cultural dynamics that have shaped Italy's history since its unification. Starting from Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio, we will see how different authors have used fantastic tales as a way to transgress literary and linguistic boundaries. From the Futurism of Aldo Palazzeschi and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, moving through Massimo Bontempelli and Alberto Savinio's Surrealism, to the weird tales of Tommaso Landolfi and Dino Buzzati and the metaphysical works of Anna Maria Ortese and Italo Calvino, students will become more familiar with the literary canon and specific aspects of Italian history and culture.

How can we live in a highly imperfect world? And what can film do that other media can't? We'll think about all of these great questions with the help of films that are philosophically stimulating, stylistically intriguing, and, for the most part, gripping to watch: Do The Right Thing (Lee), The Dark Knight (Nolan), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Kaufman), Arrival (Villeneuve), My Dinner with André (Malle), Blade Runner (Scott), La Jetée (Marker), Fight Club (Fincher), No Country for Old Men (Coen), The Seventh Seal (Bergman), and Memento (Nolan).

ITALIC 92:,Art Worlds: Conversations between Artists and Scholars,"ITALIC 92, Art Worlds: Conversations between Artists and Scholars. This course is built around a series of conversations between nine scholar/critic and artist pairs. We will be entering the conversation in media res, as it were, since all of these pairs have histories together; they've had studio visits, late-night phone calls, email and text conversations. Usually the scholar has written about the artist and maybe the artist has suggested reading and viewing lists to the scholar. They've helped each other feel seen, and often be seen in a more literal way.The conversations will concentrate on these questions: How do artists and scholars work across the divide between practice and theory? How should you build your art world and who will be in it? The pairs will discuss their respective practices (art-making, writing, researching, community-building) and engage in conversation about the artist's work. In advance of each conversation, students will read about something written by the scholar/critic about the artist. Each artist will also design a short art-making prompt for enrolled students to complete and share through the course website. Students will share their artworks weekly in small critique groups."

These systems of thought appeared first in China, and eventually spread to Korea and Japan. Each culture developed its own ways of reconciling the competing systems, but in each case the comprehensive structure of values and human ideals differs significantly from those that appeared elsewhere in the ancient world. The course examines East Asian ideas about self-cultivation, harmonious society, rulership, and the relation between human and nature with a view toward expanding our understanding of these issues in human history, and highlighting their legacies in Asian civilizations today.

All the readings are in English and this course presupposes no background in Jewish Law. Jewish Law is the world's oldest complex legal systems with distinct and idiosyncratic approaches to family, commercial, ritual and many other areas of law. It also has developed an elaborate ""conflicts of law"" sub-literature focusing on when should Jewish Law apply and when should some other legal system apply, reflecting the long history of the Jewish community in the diaspora as a minority. In this course, we will consider how Jewish law approaches a number of specific topics and we will ponder as well the proper interaction between Jewish law and secular legal norms, Jewish Law and changes in technology, Jewish law and sovereignty, Jewish Law and Bioethics and Jewish law and Family. Other topics will be added as we all see fit. Students who are interested in makin more »"
JEWISHST 348:,"Writing Between Languages: The Case of Eastern European Jewish Literature (JEWISHST 148, SLAVIC 198, SLAVIC 398)","Eastern European Jews spoke and read Hebrew, Yiddish, and their co-territorial languages (Russian, Polish, etc.). In the modern period they developed secular literatures in all of them, and their writing reflected their own multilinguality and evolving language ideologies. We focus on major literary and sociolinguistic texts. Reading and discussion in English; students should have some reading knowledge of at least one relevant language as well. This course must be taken for a minimum of 3 units and a letter grade to be eligible for WAYS credit. In 2020-21, a 'letter' or 'CR' grade will satisfy the WAYS requirement."
KOREA 20:,"Humanities Core: Dao, Virtue, and Nature -- Foundations of East Asian Thought (CHINA 20, HUMCORE 20, JAPAN 20)","This course explores the values and questions posed in the formative period of East Asian civilizations. Notions of a Dao (""Way"") are common to Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism, but those systems of thought have radically different ideas about what that Dao is and how it might be realized in society and an individual's life. These systems of thought appeared first in China, and eventually spread to Korea and Japan. Each culture developed its own ways of reconciling the competing systems, but in each case the comprehensive structure of values and human ideals differs significantly from those that appeared elsewhere in the ancient world. The course examines East Asian ideas about self-cultivation, harmonious society, rulership, and the relation between human and nature with a view toward expanding our understanding of these issues in human history, and highlighting their legacies in Asian civilizations today. The course features selective readings in classics of Confucian, Daoist, and more »"

But the everyday experience of modernity was structured more profoundly by the widening gulf between the country and the city, economically, politically, and culturally. This course examines literary and cinematic works from China and Japan that respond to and reflect on the city/country divide, framing it against issues of class, gender, national identity, and ethnicity. It also explores changing ideas about home/hometown, native soil, the folk, roots, migration, enlightenment, civilization, progress, modernization, nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and sustainability. All materials are in English. This course is part of the Humanities Core: https://humanitiescore.stanford.edu/"
LATINAM 248:,Racial and Gender Inequalities in Latin America,"This course explores the intersection between racial and gender inequalities in Latin America focusing on the historical pattern of racism, sexism and discrimination, and on the political and social changes that have enabled Afro-descendants and women to achieve social rights in some countries of the region such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Uruguay. The first part of this course introduces the struggle of political movements taking into consideration the historical process of race and gender discrimination. It will address not only the history of blacks¿ and women's movements in the 20th century, but also racism and sexism as cultural and institutional elements that configure inequality in those countries. Socio-economic indicators, race and gender-based violence, and political participation will be analyzed. The second part of this course examines the most recent discourses about women and afro-descendant rights, and their political framework. It evaluates how they have changed public opinion, laws and the social, institutional and political environment of Latin America. Finally, this course discusses the ability of Afro-descendants and women movements to navigate in the current political climate and advance their rights.nCourse will be taught in Portuguese."
LAW 240J:,"Discussion (1L): Religion, Identity and Law","This seminar will focus on the dynamic interplay between religious identity, community, and worldview, and the study, practice, and profession of law. As a defining force for so many across the globe, and in the norms through which human beings recognize their rights and arrange their affairs, religion has a unique and abiding impact on the work and life of aspiring and practicing lawyers ¿ for believers and nonbelievers alike. Whether as first-year law students or seasoned practitioners, the need to anticipate, appreciate, and reconcile religious perspectives is both a vital professional skill and an illuminating resource for self-understanding and mutual respect. The class will meet across three on-campus sessions and a closing offsite dinner, and will include a collaborative exploration of primary and secondary sources, as well as custom conversational frameworks.

Readings will discuss issues such as the relationship between civil and political rights and economic, social, and cultural rights; the relationship between anti-colonial movements and anti-racism; the context of the Cold War; the development of treaties such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; and U.S. attitudes of exceptionalism towards international legal regimes.

LAW 241A:,Discussion (1L): Why is the USA Exceptional -- In Crime and Punishment?,"It has long been a national controversy, and for many an international embarrassment, that the imprisonment rate in this country stands at the very top among nations -- currently just barely behind those of countries we would never want to be compared to and several multiples higher than those of other developed industrialized democracies. And for many years it has been almost a cliché that we also have an internationally anomalously high crime rate. The crime gap between us and our ""peer nations"" has narrowed in recent years but is still notable, at least for violent crime. In the seminar we will read an interdisciplinary set of explorations about whether there are things in ""national DNA"" that explain each of these phenomena and possibly both at once. The perspectives will include the political history of our roots in both revolution and slavery and the legacy of Reconstruction, and cultural/anthropological theories about the ""frontier mentality,"" as well as such distinct factors as more »"
LAW 241E:,Discussion (1L): Crime and Punishment in American History,"This discussion seminar will deal with the relationship between criminal justice and American society, at various points in American history. The emphasis will not be on doctrines of criminal law, or case-law in general, but on the living law, and the ways in which criminal justice arose out of and reflected social norms and the structure of society. Among the topics to be covered: First, a look at criminal justice in the early colonial period, asking what was distinctive about crime and punishment in the small communities of the 17th and 18th centuries. Second, the intimate connection between race and criminal justice, from slavery through the Jim Crow era. Third: corrections and law enforcement -- the penitentiary, police and detective squads, the reform wave in the late 19th century, and what all of these reveal about the nature of American criminality; and the public reaction to crime and punishment. We will also consider informal justice, including the vigilante movement in the Am more »"

We will use Jonathan Rauch's new book, The Constitution of Knowledge: A Defense of Truth ((Brookings 2021) as a springboard for discussion. The great strength of this book is that it addresses threats to democratic discourse from all sides of the political spectrum. We will talk about the role of social media, traditional media, politicians (including former President Trump), as well as law schools, students, and faculty. Elements used in grading: Full attendance, reading of assigned materials, and active participation. The seminar will meet four times during the Fall quarter.

LAW 241K:,Discussion (1L): Governing Poverty,"Decades of cuts to local government have wreaked havoc on communities left behind by the modern economy. Some of these discarded places are rural, others are urban. Some are conservative, some are progressive. Some are the most diverse communities in America, others are segregated. All are routinely trashed by outsiders for their poverty and their politics. Mostly, their governments are just broke. When a high-poverty city or county has run out of services to cut, properties to sell, bills to defer, and risky loans to take, what should its elected leaders do to ameliorate the harms of concentrated poverty? In this discussion group, students will engage readings, documentaries, and visual media about these topics. Each session, they will read one place-based chapter from Professor Anderson's forthcoming book, The Fight to Save the Town, which focuses on local networks of leaders and residents who are facing these challenges. Students will leave the course with a richer sense of the live more »"
LAW 241Q:,"Discussion (1L): Rationalism, Contrarianism, and Bayesian Thinking in Politics: How to Think Better?","In the early 2010s, the Bay Area spawned a movement of thinkers obsessed with cognitive biases and ""Bayesian reasoning,"" a way of using statistics and probability to inform beliefs. This group--that later came to be known as ""rationalists""--insists on subjecting all spheres of life to scientific scrutiny and probabilistic reasoning. Rationalist takes are often contrarian and challenge mainstream ways of thinking about topics that include everything from science and medicine to philosophy and politics to the rise of artificial intelligence. Rationalist writings in blogs and books can be controversial. For example, some rationalists have discussed the genetics of depression or intelligence. Since 2015, however, rationalism has become a brand in Silicon Valley and hugely influential among pundits and executives.

LAW 807P:,Policy Practicum: New Regulatory and Policy Frameworks for Government Remote Work in Times of Crisis,"Background: With the sudden onslaught of the pandemic COVID 19 creating emergency requirements regarding professional and social distancing, government agencies in California have had to implement ""telework"" or remote work policies quickly, with limited guidance and limited awareness of best practices. Government agencies are complex institutions, performing diverse and vital functions and employing a wide variety of types of employees, some of whom are represented by labor bargaining units. They handle and manage information subject to privacy protections, and many of the communications engaged in between employees and with members of the public are also subject to public disclosure requirements. Public agencies also face financial, technological, and personnel resource limitations. California state agencies need to be able to anticipate work and access issues due to its experiences with natural and manmade disasters, frequently in the form of earthquakes and fires.

Whereas earlier armed conflicts have inspired the establishment of international or hybrid tribunals (such as the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and the Special Court for Sierra Leone) or were referred to the International Criminal Court (such as the situations in Sudan and Libya), today¿s conflicts have been met with a pervasive tribunal fatigue and geopolitical impasses. The U.N.

Jurisdictions around the country are scrambling to deal with massive shifts to mail balloting, polling place closures, and loss of poll workers. Students in this policy lab will investigate the measures state and local officials are taking to protect their elections from the effect of the pandemic. Students will research, write and/or update policy memos on election preparedness in battleground states, work with our partners to recruit poll workers to reduce the risk of polling place closures due to poll worker shortages, prepare materials for voter outreach and education, and help ensure polling place safety.

We will explore whether there are policy possibilities lying at the intersection of the community policing movement - which advocated shifting police departments away from ""chasing 911 calls"" - and current calls to ""defund"" the police by shifting to other other agencies functions now performed by armed, uniformed officers. In particular, we will consider proposals to shift mental health response, school discipline, traffic enforcement, and homeless services away from armed, uniformed officers. What kinds of agencies should shoulder these responsibilities? How should the transfer be accomplished? We will also ask how these policy changes relate to, complement, or compete with other possible approaches to police reform and the transformatio more »"

LAW 808C:,Policy Practicum: Examining Mandatory Arbitration and NDAs for Gender Discrimination Claims,"Client: Lift Our Voices, https://www.liftourvoices.org/. In recent years, a large fraction of U.S. employers--including many leading law firms -- have required their employees to sign contracts containing mandatory arbitration clauses and ""non-disclosure agreements"" (NDAs). Available research suggests that more than 60 million American workers are bound by these arbitration clauses, which require employees who have any type of legal claim arising out of their work or workplace to waive their right to trial and resolve their claims, on an individual basis, in private arbitration. Traditionally, arbitration takes place behind closed doors, and the details of the employee's claim (and employer's response), any evidence presented to the arbitrators, the proceedings themselves and the ultimate outcome are confidential. Moreover, employees who are offered monetary settlements to resolve their arbitration claims -- or lawsuits, for those who were not compelled to arbitrate under a contractua more »"

The 2021-22 redistricting cycle will determine for the subsequent decade whether congressional and legislative elections will be free and fair or whether they will be inherently biased in favor of one party. With remaining ambiguity over federal partisan gerrymandering claims removed with the Supreme Court's decision in Rucho v. Common Cause (2019), parties in control of the redistricting process will seek now, as previously, to use their power to craft district lines to their advantage. Lawyers will continue to litigate claims based on race discrimination, malapportionment, and state constitutional grounds, and courts may be placed in the position of drawing districts themselves when parties cannot agree on a plan. However, we know from previous cycles that the most important time to affect the redistricting process is in the frenzied year when lines are being drawn.

Those at particularly high risk of Taliban attacks and reprisals include women and girls, ethnic and religious minority groups, human rights advocates, journalists, and individuals who worked with or on behalf of the United States during the 20-year war in Afghanistan. The U.S. government was able to evacuate some of these individuals and their families, but hundreds of thousands more remain in Afghanistan, and many are seeking any opportunity for safe passage out of the country. They include thousands of staff members, former students, and other affiliates of the American University of Afghanistan (AUAF), a U.S.-funded institution in Kabul that has provided educational opportunities to thousands of graduates.

LAW 808Q:,Policy Practicum: Restoring Net Neutrality,"In 2017, the FCC eliminated all net neutrality protections and renounced its authority over broadband. That stunning reversal of two decades of FCC policy set off a public firestorm, prompted states like California to step in with their own protections, and led to protracted legal battles. Though the timing is unclear, a new FCC will likely revisit net neutrality with the goal of restoring open internet protections at the federal level. Two of the current four commissioners have said restoring net neutrality is a high priority. Gigi Sohn, a long-time supporter of net neutrality, is the nominee for the fifth seat. Additionally, the European Union's political leadership is promoting a plan to require some online apps to pay broadband providers directly so that their services can be used by those broadband providers' customers. This would reverse decades of precedent and is a direct assault on the EU's net neutrality protections. That means this fall will present a unique window for resea more »"

LAW 808S:,Policy Practicum: Reducing Copyright Barriers to Creativity: The Problem of Orphan Works,"Orphan works--copyrighted works that have no readily identifiable owner--represent the single greatest legal hurdle to creativity today. A film maker wants to make a documentary about the portrayal of minority groups in 1950s motion pictures, but cannot track down the present copyright owners of the dozens of film clips that must be licensed to complete the project. A video game producer has found just the right sound recordings to sample in its latest release, but cannot locate their copyright owners to negotiate a license. The examples can be multiplied across all forms of creative commerce. The copyright doctrine of fair use will excuse some, but far from all, of these uses, and the doctrine's application is at best unpredictable.

LAW 808T:,Policy Practicum: Integrating Water and Land Use Policy in the West: The Missing Link,"The western United States is currently experiencing what may be the longest and most severe ""megadrought"" in modern U.S. history. Current U.S. drought data shows virtually all of the Southwest in severe, extreme, or extraordinary drought. Reservoirs on the Colorado River are reaching record lows, and many farmers throughout the West have had their deliveries cut dramatically or face potentially massive cutbacks. Media discussion of episodic, emergency ""droughts"" has been replaced by a recognition of the permanent ""aridification"" of the West under climate change. Resolving the West's growing water crisis will require far greater linkage of water management and land use. Land use drives water demand, while water availability constrains land use.

LAW 2008:,Three Strikes Project: Criminal Justice Reform & Individual Representation,"This seminar offers an opportunity to study mass incarceration and criminal law reform in real time while getting hands-on experience in active litigation on behalf of Three Strikes Project clients serving life sentences for nonviolent crimes. In many ways, the era of mass incarceration began in California with the enactment of the ""Three Strikes and You're Out"" sentencing law in 1994. Today, California leads political and policy trends in the opposite direction with a number of critical reforms to the state's criminal legal system. Some of the momentum shift began with students in the Three Strikes Project, who have helped overturn a record number of life sentences and contributed to critical reforms to California sentencing law. In this course, students read and analyze a variety of cases and articles, examining the evolution of incarceration and sentencing policies in California and across the country. Students also assist with live post-conviction litigation on behalf of clients in more »"
LAW 2019:,Criminal Procedure: Theoretical Foundations,"This course examines the theoretical foundations of criminal procedure---political, historical, and, above all, philosophical. What are the ideas at work in the American system of criminal procedure? How, historically, did the system develop, and why does it presently function as it does? Is the system broken and, if so, what principles should orient us in fixing it? This theoretical inquiry has a practical point. Procedure plays a major role in the present crisis of American criminal justice. By examining criminal procedure's theoretical foundations, this course aims to develop competing ""big picture,"" synthetic perspectives on the criminal justice crisis as a whole. Thus, for students interested in criminal justice reform, this course will equip you to take a philosophically richer view of the underlying policy issues. For students thinking about a career in criminal law, this course will equip you to engage in large-scale thinking about how criminal procedure should change, rather t more »"
LAW 2020:,History of Criminal Justice,"This seminar will deal with the history of criminal justice in the United States, since the colonial period. The emphasis will not be on doctrines of criminal law, or (for the most part) on reported case law; but rather on the relationship between the working criminal justice system and American society. Indeed, throughout our history, there has been a huge gulf between the formal law and the way the system actually operated. At all points, the criminal justice system has responded to social, economic, political and cultural factors; and it is these that the course will focus on. The students will read a number of original sources that bear on the relationship between law and society, including sources on the rise of the penitentiary, the death penalty, the development of correctional methods, such as parole and indeterminate sentences; also race and gender relations and their influence on criminal justice.

LAW 2027:,Prosecutorial Discretion and Ethical Duties in the Enforcement of Federal Criminal Law,"Prosecutors wield enormous power over life, liberty and reputation and are subject to ethical standards higher than those that apply to other attorneys. As former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sutherland recognized in the context of federal prosecutors, ""[t]he United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all, and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done."" A U.S. Attorney may ""strike hard blows"" but not ""foul ones."" This course examines the distinct roles and responsibilities of U.S. Attorneys in the enforcement of federal criminal laws. We will review the ways in which a federal prosecutor exercises discretion in deciding whether or not to charge, what crimes to charge, and what punishments to seek. We will examine charging both individuals and corporate entities in more »"
LAW 2029:,Law and Disorder: Advanced Criminal Law,"This seminar is essentially an advanced criminal law class in which we will be studying selected criminal law/procedure issues.

As you may know there are nearly 1000 episodes and we will be watching and discussing only nine. There are many strong and differing opinions about favorite episodes, so it is likely we will not be studying one of your personal favorites. We will however, discuss such recurring issues like police cutting corners in connection with 4th and 5th Amendment rights, the role of plea bargaining, the role of different actors in the system and so much more. The class will meet twice a week for (60/75?) minutes.

LAW 2401:,Advanced Civil Procedure,"This course will address significant areas of procedural law and design that go beyond the first- year civil procedure course, with special attention to aggregate and multiparty litigation (e.g., class actions and Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)). Contemporary litigation frequently involves multiple related actions, multiple parties, and multiple claims that may interact in complex ways, and often aspires to reform institutions in addition to seeking remedies for discrete past harms. This course introduces procedural doctrine, theory, norms, and practice related to complex and/or public law litigation, including such topics as the joinder of claims and parties, claim and issue preclusion, class action law, multidistrict litigation and other forms of aggregation, and the turn towards mandatory arbitration. We will spend much of the quarter on class actions and MDLs (which account for 20-40% of all federal cases!). The course should be of particular interest to aspiring litigators (in any more »"
LAW 2403:,Federal Courts,"This course addresses the role of the federal courts in the American system of federalism and separation of powers, as well as their role in the development of substantive federal law and constitutional rights. A central premise of the course is that the institutional, political, and constitutional features of federal litigation cannot be understood without engaging the historical and theoretical context, especially the social, political, and legal movements in response to which the federal courts have developed and related assumptions about structural constitutional theory (including federalism, supremacy, separation of powers, and judicial review). Thus while many of the traditional aspects of federal court jurisprudence will be covered (e.g., federal common law including implied rights of action, justiciability doctrines and other doctrines of restraint, congressional power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and to create ""legislative courts"" outside of Article III, Sup more »"
LAW 2404:,Global Litigation,"German owned VW admits that it included a ""defeat device"" in the software for its diesel cars so they could fraudulently pass US environmental tests, and is sued by thousands of US consumers in state and federal courts in the US. Very quickly, the cases are consolidated in the federal court in Northern California. Meanwhile, special purpose foundations are established in the Netherlands to seek a settlement with VW on behalf of European consumers under the Dutch collective settlement act, and a securities lawsuit on behalf of investors whose share values have dropped dramatically is filed in Germany, using that country's special group litigation procedure. The Dutch foundations may be coordinating their actions with US lawyers, the shareholders in Germany are represented by the local partners of a leading US-based litigation boutique, and the shareholder suit is funded by a UK-based international litigation financing firm.

LAW 2503:,Energy Law,"All modern industrial economies, including that in the U.S., require massive energy infrastructure and a coherent legal framework to ensure that energy services are provided to consumers of all types in a manner that is safe, reliable and affordable. Because of climate change, it is also increasingly clear that our energy sources must be sustainable. The focus of this course is on the electricity and natural gas industries, which operate in the U.S. under a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework involving extensive interplay between federal and state authorities. This course provides a strong grounding in the governing legal principles. It draws upon case-law, primarily decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court, to bring these principles into focus. We will examine the respective roles of regulation and market forces in this field. Students who complete the class will gain a historical understanding of how economic regulation of the energy industry has evolved since its origins in the more »"
LAW 2509:,Clean Energy Project Development and Finance,"(Formerly Law 774) This case study-oriented course will focus on the critical skills needed to evaluate, develop, finance (on a non-recourse basis), and complete grid-scale clean energy projects.

The course has consistently had a significant mix of business, engineering, law and earth science students. As in the past, the course will focus on the issues associated with the business of developing, financing, constructing and operating grid-scale clean energy projects. The course will focus on what a project developer or lender (i.e., in either case, the business person) needs to know to develop and finance successful projects. The project development business--far more than many other businesses such as tech, manufacturing, consumer, services, retail or transportation--inherently involves a VE more »"
LAW 2512:,"Cities and Sustainability: Current Issues, Policy, and Law","Cities are on the front lines of solving many of society's sustainability problems, from advancing green buildings and clean energy, to preparing for the effects of climate change. With a diminishing role of the federal government on environmental policy and regulation, it is up to sub-nationals like states and cities to lead innovation and deployment of clean energy, resilience strategies, water management, and more. This class will explore the evolving role of cities in advancing sustainability from the lens of law, policy, planning, and governance. Some of the topics we will discuss in-depth include climate mitigation, clean energy, green buildings, climate adaptation and resilience, water supply and reuse, land use and transportation, and more. Case studies will focus on U.S. cities with some emphasis on California. Overarching themes across all content areas include legal constraints of city authority, governance, socioeconomic tradeoffs, and the roles of various types of institutions in developing, advancing, and advocating for local policy change.

Elements used in grading include attendance and participation, preparation of written questions for the speakers, and short reflection papers."
LAW 2525:,Public Lands,"The federal government owns and manages 28% of all land in the United States, and 48% in California, the third-highest percentage in the nation. How the federal government manages public lands therefore has profound implications for countless constituencies and users, affecting everything from recreation to conservation to more intensive uses such as mining, timber production, and cattle grazing. This seminar will explore the history, operation, power, and limits of America's federal public-land laws. We will focus on four specific types of public lands--national forests, BLM lands, national parks, and wildlife refuges, learning about the governing laws of each and using modern-day controversies to examine how those laws work in practice and whether (and how) they need changing. We will also devote attention to the historic and present-day exclusion of (and injustices toward) Indigenous peoples and tribes in our public-lands system and opportunities for repair and inclusion moving forw more »"

LAW 3259:,The Civil Justice System as an Agent of Change,"The past 60 years have witnessed a dramatic expansion in the role of the courts as an agent of change in the United States. Constitutional, civil and economic rights have been created, such as marriage equality and strict liability in tort, but rights have also been limited through statutory restrictions and other means. The role of the judge has grown to activist and administrator in cases such as prison reform and housing desegregation. And through it all, it has been lawyers who have fought, won, and lost the battles of expansion and contraction of rights and remedies. Where the government fails to protect us, private practitioners serve a crucial role in challenging the legal ""status quo"" through civil litigation; vindication of a particular client's claim can simultaneously establish or clarify the rights in question on a societal scale. Taught by an experienced trial lawyer, along with guests from both plaintiff and defense practices, course readings and discussion will draw on a more »"
LAW 3508:,Law and Visual Culture,"When we represent our experience today, we do so as much through images as language. When we seek to persuade, we offer photographs, charts, videos. When we witness misconduct, we pull out our smartphones. And as images saturate our cultural discourse, they are increasingly part of legal practice. The power of an image often lies in its apparent simplicity: we know it when we see it. But how much of what we see is produced by the biases and expectations -- the habits of viewing -- that we bring to the encounter? What is left out when an infographic distills information for us? Lawyers and judges have historically tended to treat certain kinds of images as unmediated representations of reality, even though neuroscience, empirical research, and cultural theory all refute this so-called reality effect. Such naïve realism maps on to an ideal of definitive proof embedded in the adversary system. And it haunts our efforts to adapt legal practice to visual persuasion in ways that are consiste more »"
LAW 4001:,"Media, Technology, and the First Amendment","The right to free speech is meaningless without spaces to exercise it. Over the past decades, electronic media---broadcast radio and television, cable television, telephony, and the internet---have become critical spaces where Americans speak to and with each other. Today, being able to speak and be heard online is as important as being able to speak in parks, sidewalks, and public squares. As the Supreme Court has recognized, social media platforms ""provide perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard,"" so that any citizen may ""become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox."" Packingham v. North Carolina, 137 S. Ct. 1730, 1737 (2017). But while the public squares of the colonies were public spaces, the social media platforms hosting much of Americans' online speech today are owned by private actors with their own First Amendment rights. And court decisions about electronic media differ signif more »"
LAW 4003:,Current Issues in Network Neutrality,"Due to the change in administration, the future of net neutrality in the US is in question again. Network neutrality rules are based on a simple principle: Internet service providers like Verizon or Comcast that connect us to the Internet should not control what happens on the Internet. Net neutrality rules prohibit ISPs from blocking or slowing down websites, making some sites more attractive than others, or charging sites fees to reach people faster. After a long, public fight that mobilized more than 4 million people across the political spectrum, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted strong net neutrality rules in February 2015. Now these rules might be on the chopping block. FCC Chairman Pai, who opposed the rules when they were adopted, has declared his intention to roll back the rules, while expressing some support for ""net neutrality principles."" At the same time, Republicans in Congress have indicated they might consider a legislative solution. Through lectures, more »"
LAW 4007:,Intellectual Property: Copyright,"Copyright law is the engine that drives not only such traditional entertainment and information industries as music, book publishing, news and motion pictures, but also software, video games and other digital products. This course examines in depth all aspects of copyright law and practice, as well as the business and policy challenges and opportunities that the Internet and other new technologies present for the exploitation of copyrighted works. There are no prerequisites for this class. Elements used in grading: Final Exam (open book). A detailed description of how the class will be conducted, including reading assignments and modes of student participation, appears in the course syllabus on Canvas."
LAW 4013:,Information Privacy Law,"This course explores the roots of privacy law, its evolution in the face of rapid technological change, and the challenges to an individual's ability to control third party collection, access, use and disclosure of their personal information. The course covers existing and emerging privacy torts, applicable and proposed privacy legislation and regulations, international norms and extraterritorial application of privacy law such as in the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, and self-regulation of privacy through technological means, contracts or other means. We will discuss all of these things, as well as incorporate developments in the news, from the perspective of the various privacy stakeholders--consumers, regulators and business. Elements used in grading: Final Exam."
LAW 4024:,Patent Prosecution,"This skill-based course examines the core requirements and strategies for drafting and prosecuting a patent application before the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (PTO). The class brings in real inventors and patent examiners to give students a real-world experience of developing a patent, understanding patentability, building patent portfolios, and getting a patent application prosecuted through the patent office. Students will interact with inventors in a startup-type environment and help the startup protect the IP in its technology -- through interactions with the inventors to identify and develop concepts and draft corresponding patent applications, and through interactions with the PTO to get the patents assessed against prior art and eventually granted. The course is open to all students, regardless of your technical (or non-technical) undergraduate background. All you require is an interest in technology or patent law. This class will give you a solid understanding of what patent more »"
LAW 4028:,Intellectual Property: Advanced Copyright,"Copyright law is the primary legal regime governing human creativity, and it plays some role in nearly all creative industries today. Consequently, copyright law has far-reaching economic and cultural implications. In this seminar, we will consider the interests of some of the different groups affected by the copyright regime, including creators, technologists, audiences, institutions, and heirs. Course readings will cover copyright case law and scholarship; research on creative practices and relevant business models; the role of copyright law in innovation policy; and legal versus extralegal modes of protecting the fruits of creative labor. Throughout, we will assess the fairness, efficacy, and alignment of copyright protection and remedies available, to whom, when, and for what reasons. The course aims to deepen students' knowledge of copyright law and scholarship; to equip students to develop principled policy arguments about the scope of copyright protection; and to enable students more »"
LAW 4032:,Advanced Negotiation of Patent Reform Policies,"Patent reform has been a hotly debated topic in recent years in the intellectual property field. Different industries and players have differing and often competing views of our patent system--how effective it is in promoting innovation and what, if any, reform is needed. Students will play the role of counsel on one or more teams representing the interests of particular stakeholder groups. The teams will engage in a series of mock negotiations on actual legislative or administrative patent reform proposals with other teams, as well as mock legislative or administrative engagements before Congress or the United States Patent and Trademark Office respectively. The goal is to achieve consensus on patent reforms that best serve the stakeholders' individual and collective interests, all in an environment of competing interests. Through experience-based learning and simulations, students will gain an understanding of some of the most current patent policy issues being debated in Congress an more »"
LAW 4041:,Lawyering for Innovation: Artificial Intelligence,"In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made the jump from science fiction to technical viability to product reality. Industries as far flung as finance, transportation, defense, and healthcare invest billions in the field. Patent filings for robotics and machine learning applications have surged. And policymakers are beginning to grapple with technologies once confined to the realm of computer science, such as predictive analytics and neural networks. AI's rise to prominence came thanks to a confluence of factors. Increased computing power, large-scale data collection, and advancements in machine learning---all accompanied by dramatic decreases in costs---have resulted in machines that now have the ability to exhibit complex ""intelligent"" behaviors. They can navigate in real-world environments, process natural language, diagnose illnesses, predict future events, and even conquer strategy games. These abilities, in turn, have allowed companies and governments to entrust machi more »"
LAW 4045:,Digital Technology and Law: Foundations,"Taught by a team of law and engineering faculty, this unique interdisciplinary course will empower students across the University to work together and exercise leadership on critically important debates at the intersection of law and digital technology. Designed as an accessible survey, the course will equip students with two powerful bases of knowledge: (i) a working technical grasp of key digital technologies (e.g., AI and machine learning, internet structure, encryption, blockchain); and (ii) basic fluency in the key legal frameworks implicated by each (e.g., privacy, cybersecurity, anti-discrimination, free speech, torts, procedural fairness). Substantively, the course will be organized into modules focused on distinct law-tech intersections, including: platform regulation, speech, and intermediary liability; algorithmic bias and civil rights; autonomous systems, safety, and tort liability; ""smart"" contracting; data privacy and consumer protection; ""legal tech,"" litigation, and acc more »"
LAW 4046:,"Data: Privacy, Property and Security","The collection, use and marketing of personal data are ubiquitous in the digital age. This seminar will explore the diverse legal regimes regulating personal data--including privacy, property and security--and the imperfect nature of their protections. Legal rules are rapidly evolving to address, if not resolve, the inevitable conflicts between privacy, property and security in relation to personal data. Laws have been enacted and new ones are under consideration at the national, state and even municipal levels, as well as around the world. Norms are emerging to guide these conflicts in the operation of business. Technology is evolving that can facilitate the protection, or accelerate the exploitation, of personal data. At the heart of all these developments is the question, who owns and controls personal data in the digital age. The same piece of data may in different hands raise different expectations. As an example, A may have a privacy expectation that her purchase from an online m more »"
LAW 4049:,Hack Lab,"This course aims to give students a solid understanding of the most common types of attacks used in cybercrime and cyberwarfare. Taught by a long-time cybersecurity practitioner, a recovering cyberlaw litigator, and a group of hearty, motivated TAs, each session will begin with a lecture covering the basics of an area of technology and how that technology has been misused in the past. Students will then complete a lab section, with the guidance of the instructor and assistants, where they attack a known insecure system using techniques and tools seen in the field. Each week, there will be a second lecture on the legal and policy impacts of the technologies and techniques we cover. By the end of the course, students are expected to have a basic understanding of some of the most common offensive techniques in use today as well as a comprehensive overview of the most important aspects of cyberpolicy and law. No computer science background is required. All students must have access to a Wi more »"
LAW 4053:,Confronting Misinformation Online: Law and Policy,"This course will examine contemporary challenges and trade-offs for tech law and policy decision-making presented by false information online. Topics will include content policy and regulatory responses to election misinformation; medical misinformation; the spread of misinformation in armed conflict and situations of widespread human rights violations; and conspiracy theories and rumors in the areas of science, climate, religion, and politics. Along with the faculty, guest speakers from academia and industry thought leaders will present on these topics, followed by a discussion. In addition, students will analyze real-world dilemmas confronting policymakers through practical case studies and will assume the role of a policymaker from either the private sector, the government, or a non-governmental organization as part of each class. Finally, this course will explore regulatory, policy, technological, and other solutions to enhance the integrity of the online information ecosystem and more »"
LAW 4055:,In House Product and Technology Counsel,"This course provides a rigorous, hands-on, practical overview of the essential skills you'll need in today's practice of global technology and commercial transactions as in-house counsel. Students will learn key terms in commercial, IP and technology transactions, the art of collaborative negotiations with opposing counsel, and the development of interpersonal soft skills to successfully advise and counsel internal stakeholders in product-focused technology companies. Students will learn to draft, review and negotiate agreements such as (1) NDAs; (2) Product, Hardware and Manufacturing Supply Agreements; (3) Engineering Services, Design and Development Agreements; (4) Software License Agreements; and (5) Joint Development Agreements. Additionally, students will consider issues that arise during the contract lifecycle, handling business disputes, transactional ethics, dealing with stress & deal fatigue. This course is different from the typical law one examining law firm practice becaus more »"
LAW 4056:,Net Neutrality and Broadband Deployment,"An open and affordable internet is critical to our economy, democracy, and our country's promise of equal opportunity. After the pandemic, everyone agrees on that. How we get there is the hard part. That's what the debates over net neutrality and broadband deployment are all about. This class will examine the policy issues, legal frameworks, and key court decisions that shape these two crucial debates. At its heart, net neutrality is the idea that we, the people who use the Internet, should be able to decide what we do online. We get to choose what sites to visit, what apps to use, and what videos to watch. Companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T that we pay to get online don't get to influence our choices. The policy and legal fights over net neutrality have been going on for nearly two decades, both in the U.S. and internationally. In 2015, the debate captured U.S. public attention, leading to strong FCC protections and oversight. But in 2017, the FCC eliminated all protections. Th more »"
LAW 4057:,Antitrust and the Challenges of Competition in Digital Markets,"These are unprecedented times for antitrust concerns about the market power and conduct of big technology companies, in particular Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple. The companies face an onslaught of regulatory and judicial scrutiny around the world. In the United States, the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, and state attorneys general are all investigating possible anticompetitive practices and/or have filed major antitrust lawsuits. Congress is pursuing multiple investigations, and the House Judiciary Committee released an extensive report last October detailing harms resulting from the alleged dominance of ""online platforms."" At least six bills have been introduced in Congress to expand or clarify the application of antitrust laws to ""Big Tech,"" and vocal advocates for antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech now occupy important positions in the DOJ, the FTC, and the White House. Elsewhere in the world, the European Commission is investigating and has filed charges, and Ch more »"
LAW 4058:,False Advertising,"This course covers all of the basics regarding marketing law and false advertising, a rapidly changing and expanding area of law that dovetails nicely with trademark and copyright law. In this course, we will cover the basics of false advertising claims under the Lanham Act, and also cover enforcement at the state level and by the Federal Trade Commission. We will also study how false advertising law overlaps with areas of privacy law, business torts, and constitutional law, among other areas; and pay close attention to how these areas of law map onto social media, the influencer economy, and the metaverse. Open to students who has taken either intro to IP or trademark law. Limited to 35 students. Elements used in grading: Class participation, paper assignment. Class meets from 2:00 to 4:00 on Thursdays, Jan 12, Jan 19, Jan 26, Feb 2, and Feb 9."
LAW 5006:,"International Business Transactions, Regulation and Litigation","What legal problems arise when firms go global? Lawyers are increasingly asked to advise clients with global operations and to respond to multiple and sometimes inconsistent national laws. Through a series of case studies, we put you in the driver's seat and ask you to consider the challenges of doing business around the world. How should Twitter react to free speech limitations in Turkey? How should Facebook respond when governments around the world regulate its use and collection of data? What are the consequences for a US retailer if it expands in Europe? What rights and protections must it grant its employees? How should Nike weigh the legal risk from factory fires in Bangladesh? How should investors in China (or Ethiopia or North Korea) deal with the reality that they will lack basic legal protections that are common elsewhere? We examine how multinational firms respond to variation in national laws and what tools they have at their disposal when considering deals, disputes, and regulation. Elements used in grading: a short paper, class participation, and written assignments. This class is open to ALL students (except 1Ls). It is not limited to students enrolled in the Global Quarter."
LAW 5007:,International Business Negotiation,"This course is structured around a quarter-long, simulated negotiation exercise which provides an in-depth study of the structuring and negotiating of an international business transaction. This class will be taught in counterpart with a class at Berkeley Law School. Students in this class will represent a U.S. pharmaceutical company, and the students in the class at Berkeley will represent an African agricultural production company. The two companies are interested in working together to exploit a new technology developed by the pharmaceutical company that uses the cassava produced by the African agricultural production company. The form of their collaboration could be a joint venture, a licensing agreement or a long term supply contract. The negotiations between the two classes will take place through written exchanges and through real-time negotiation which will be conducted both in-person and via videoconferences. The purpose of the course is to provide students with an opportunity more »"

All readings and instruction are in English. Japanese language ability and knowledge of Japan are not required. Elements used in grading: Attendance, Class Participation, Written Assignment, and Final Exam."
LAW 5017:,Law in Latin America,"(Formerly Law 582) The course has two main goals: to introduce students to the civil law tradition and to gain an understanding of the ways in which the law is practiced and lived in Latin American and Spain. Special attention is given to law firms, courts and legal education. The course will be especially useful for those expecting to have contact with Latin American countries or Spain in their practice of law and for those interested in comparative law or Latin American studies. All required readings are in English. In addition, students may review and present elective readings in Spanish and Portuguese. The ability to read in these languages is appreciated but not required. Elements used in grading: Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Paper."
LAW 5023:,The Rule of Law - The Foundation of Functional Communities,"We will seek to determine a useful meaning of the notion of the rule of law, to identify a credible measurement of adherence, and to explore the importance of the rule of law in terms of economic, socio-political and human development. We will focus on accountable government and private actors; just laws; open processes for the enactment, administration and enforcement of laws and impartial dispute resolution. Readings will include the works of philosophers, political theorists and jurists from the 17th to the 21st century as well as contemporary scholars. This seminar will feature experts in the field as guest lectures and requires three reaction papers from all participants. Elements used in grading: Class participation and reaction papers."
LAW 5038:,Jewish Law: Introduction and Topics,"This course will provide an overview of the field of Jewish Law and will seek to provide a few case studies of topics in Jewish Law. All the readings are in English and this course presupposes no background in Jewish Law. Jewish Law is the world's oldest complex legal systems with distinct and idiosyncratic approaches to family, commercial, ritual and many other areas of law. It also has developed an elaborate ""conflicts of law"" sub-literature focusing on when should Jewish Law apply and when should some other legal system apply, reflecting the long history of the Jewish community in the diaspora as a minority. In this course, we will consider how Jewish law approaches a number of specific topics and we will ponder as well the proper interaction between Jewish law and secular legal norms, Jewish Law and changes in technology, Jewish law and sovereignty, Jewish Law and Bioethics and Jewish law and Family. Other topics will be added as we all see fit. Students who are interested in makin more »"
LAW 5040:,"Law, Lawyers, and Transformation in Democratic South Africa","South Africa's transition to democracy in 1994 marked the formal end of the comprehensive political, economic, and social system of racial subordination known as apartheid. The country has changed dramatically since then, as the government has built several million new housing units, created social welfare systems, and created an array of government and private sector programs to combat discrimination and redress the effects of subordination. Yet the country remains among the most unequal in the world, with 64% of black South Africans living below the poverty line, compared to 1% of whites. Most non-white South Africans receive poor education, live in substandard housing, and have limited employment opportunities. ..............In recent years, discontent with the pace of economic and social transformation has boiled over. In 2015, university campuses erupted in protests. Students' demands quickly expanded from the removal of statutes of white colonizers to wider ""decolonization"" of un more »"
LAW 5042:,Comparative Law and Society,"This is a course about the relationship between law and the larger society--but with readings drawn almost entirely from studies carried out in countries other than the United States. The course will look, for examples, at readings from Chile, China, England, Germany, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Venezuela. Introduction: The aim of the seminar is to introduce students to studies of the relationship between law and society, but with an international and comparative perspective. The readings use a broad range of methods and techniques, to explore how legal rules, processes and institutions are framed by, and influence, the social context. Paying attention to the social context opens the door to a richer understanding of the law, a better explanation of what makes it work (or not work) and how it changes over time. Traditionally the field called comparative law has concentrated heavily on differences between common law and civil law; and at principles and doctrines more »"
LAW 5103:,State-Building and the Rule of Law Seminar,"The State-Building and the Rule of Law Seminar is centrally concerned with bridging theory and practice. The seminar introduces the key theories relevant to state-building generally, and strengthening the rule of law in particular. This course explores the multidisciplinary nature of development -- through readings, lectures, guest lectures, case studies, and seminar discussions --- and weighs how lawyers fit in and contribute to the process. The set of developing countries considered within the scope of this workshop is broad. It includes, among others, states engaged in post-conflict reconstruction, e.g., Cambodia, Timor Leste, Rwanda, Iraq, Sierra Leone; states still in conflict, e.g., Afghanistan, Somalia; the poorest states of the world that may not fall neatly into the categories of conflict or post-conflict, e.g., Nepal, Haiti; least developed states that are not marked by high levels of violent conflict at all, e.g., Bhutan; and more developed states at critical stages of trans more »"
LAW 5805:,Animal Law,"This course presents a survey of the historical and current status of this rapidly developing specialty. In brief, animal law encompasses all areas of the law in which the nature -- legal, social or biological -- of nonhuman animals is an important factor. It is an objective and logical specialization of a challenging area -- one with a growing number of cases and laws, increasing public and practical interest, and significantly different historical, legal and philosophical foundations than most other courses. Topics covered include animal cruelty, animals as property, tort claims regarding animals, legal issues involving farm animals and animals in entertainment, and federal statutes regarding certain groups of animals. The Animal Law course has been described as intellectually stimulating and ethically challenging, and synthesizes a wide range of legal concepts, and the course materials apply traditional ideas to legal concepts associated with animals in new ways. Students have calle more »"
LAW 5806:,Jurisprudence,"This course examines the diverse ways in which the philosophy of law bears on the practice of law. Our subject is thus a set of philosophical concepts, particularly legal positivism and natural law, but the approach is not purely conceptual. Rather, we will examine both the philosophical concepts in the abstract and how those philosophical concepts are reflected or actualized in the craft of legal argumentation, in the intellectual history of law, and in contemporary questions of politics and government. Above all, we will ask which conception of law best contributes to legal justice. The course consists in three units. Unit I is about theories of the nature of law, focusing on legal positivism and natural law. Unit II is about theories of particular departments of law, focusing on tort law and criminal law. Unit III takes a philosophical perspective on being a lawyer, focusing on questions of what principles define lawyers' role in society and what ideals give the life of a lawyer mea more »"
LAW 5807:,Feminism and the Law: Selected Topics (Reading Group),"The Reading Group will meet five times during the quarter: April 24, May 1, May 8, May 15, and May 22. We will start by considering the major schools of feminist legal theory, and then look more closely at selected topics of current interest. Topics will likely include women in the legal profession; regulating sexual misconduct; and intersectionalities of gender, race, class and religion. Students are expected to do the assigned readings and come prepared to discuss them. In addition, each student will help co-lead one of the five sessions. There are no written requirements. All students are welcome to apply. There are no prerequisites. CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available on the SLS website (Click Courses at the bottom of the homepage and then click Consent of Instructor Forms). See Consent Application Form for instructions and submission deadline. Class will meet at Prof. Fried's house (on campus)."
LAW 5810:,Behind the Doctrinal Curtain: Law School's Concepts and Themes,"When you have finished law school, you will (hopefully) have mastered a good deal of legal doctrine (many of you will review and/or sharpen your mastery of particular rules when you study for the Bar) and mastered a number of skills you will need to fulfill professional roles. (Hopefully, you will learn particular advocacy skills if you will be an advocate; writing skills that will help you whether you draft contracts or legislation, briefs or executive summaries, client letters; and, particularly in the Experiential Learning courses, skills that will help you exercise prudent judgment, collaborate with others, work both efficaciously and empathetically in a diverse world.). The claim that underlies this course is that your ""classroom"" courses here at SLS -- and at pretty much any of the academically ambitious schools that most of you considered attending -- had both a text (the doctrines and policies in the particular subject area that you were studying) and a ""sub-text"" (the concepts more »"
LAW 6001:,Legal Ethics,"This course will explore the ethical issues facing all lawyers in the practice of law. We will focus on the ABA's Model Rules of Professional Conduct as well as ethics opinions, statutes, regulations and relevant case law, with consideration of California ethics rules on select issues. We will utilize real and hypothetical case studies to contextualize the various rules and learn a process for facing ethical dilemmas. This course is interactive and attendance is one of the factors in grading. Elements used in grading: Attendance, class participation, paper, exam."
LAW 6004:,Legal Ethics: The Plaintiffs' Lawyer,"This course uses a study of plaintiffs' lawyers as a vehicle to explore many of the most controversial and important issues at the intersection of tort law, civil procedure, and legal ethics. Specifically, in this course, we will study who personal injury lawyers are, how they find clients, how they fund litigation, and how they usher complex cases to conclusion. In so doing, we will address: the role and regulation of lawyers; the use and abuse of the contingency fee; the legality and normative consequences of solicitation and attorney advertising; the propriety of secret settlements, NDAs, and expansive protective orders; the rise and impact of ""alternative litigation finance""; and the vexing issues posed by class actions, aggregate actions, consolidated actions, and multidistrict litigations (MDLs). The final segment of the course will involve a series of case studies, where students will test their knowledge of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct and have the opportunity to see more »"
LAW 6016:,Reforming the Profession: Opportunities and Challenges Facing Tomorrow's Lawyers,"Today's law students are tomorrow's lawyers, and tomorrow's lawyers face a set of fundamental challenges that are likely to reshape the profession in the years ahead. Clients are increasingly dissatisfied with large law firms, and many other people in need of services--like individuals of modest means and small businesses--are unable to access legal assistance altogether. At the same time, government and public interest lawyers continue to be asked to do more with less. These challenges existed in 2019, but the last few years have sharpened them. In particular, the Covid-19 crisis has forced a change in the way lawyers work, with greater use of technology, and the resurgence of the #BlackLivesMatter movement following the death of George Floyd highlights the lack of diversity in the profession. These developments add to existing pressures facing lawyers. Leaders in law are just beginning to grapple with these challenges, and they're looking for help from the next generation. This cours more »"
LAW 7015:,Contemporary Issues in Constitutional Law,"(Formerly 448) This is an advanced constitutional law seminar for students who have already taken the introductory Constitutional Law course. The seminar will provide an opportunity for in-depth discussion of competing theories of constitutional interpretation, the role of the Supreme Court in our political system, and analysis of judicial behavior. Each week, these themes will be examined through the lens of a current ""hot topic"" in constitutional law - for example, affirmative action, same-sex marriage, religious liberty, the death penalty, executive power, campaign finance, immigration, abortion, and other topics. This is not a ""spectator"" class; all students will be expected to participate actively in class discussion each week. This is a good seminar for students interested in clerking or pursuing academia. Prerequisite: Constitutional Law. Elements used in grading: Attendance, Participation, Written Assignments."
LAW 7020:,"Ethics On the Edge: Business, Non-Profit Organizations, Government, and Individuals","The objective of the course is to explore the increasing ethical challenges in a world in which technology, global risks, and societal developments are accelerating faster than our understanding and the law can keep pace. We will unravel the factors contributing to the seemingly pervasive failure of ethics today among organizations and leaders across all sectors: business, government, non-profit, and academia. A framework for ethical decision-making underpins the course. There is significant space for personal reflection and forming your own views on a wide range of issues. Prominent guest speakers will attend certain sessions interactively. The relationship between ethics and culture, leadership, law, and global risks (inequality, privacy, financial system meltdown, cyber-terrorism, climate change, etc.) will inform discussion. A broad range of international topics might include: designer genetics; civilian space travel (Elon Musk's Mars plans); social media (e.g. Facebook Cambridge A more »"
LAW 7025:,Employment Law,"Workplace issues have become one of the fastest-growing areas of state and federal law. Employment-related lawsuits filed in federal court have tripled in volume in the past decade, and now account for a tenth of all civil cases. Many state courts have experienced a similar burgeoning of their employment law caseloads. This course examines this diverse, rewarding, and rapidly evolving area of legal practice by considering the diverse array of laws and institutions that regulate the employment relationship. The focus of the course is on laws that affect employees in non-unionized settings, such as protections against dismissal without cause, wage and hour restrictions, workplace privacy, covenants not to compete, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and mandatory arbitration of employment disputes. The course does not cover either Employment Discrimination or Labor Law, both of which are offered as separate courses. Special Instructions: Regular, punctual attendance is required. If you exp more »"
LAW 7036:,Law of Democracy,"This course is intended to give students a basic understanding of the themes in the legal regulation of elections and politics. We will cover all the major Supreme Court cases on topics of voting rights, reapportionment/redistricting, ballot access, regulation of political parties, campaign finance, and the 2000 presidential election controversy. The course pays particular attention to competing political philosophies and empirical assumptions that underlie the Court's reasoning while still focusing on the cases as litigation tools used to serve political ends. Elements used in grading: Class participation and final exam. Cross-listed with Communication ( COMM 361) International Policy ( INTLPOL 351), and Political Science ( POLISCI 327C)."
LAW 7043:,Strategic Litigation for Racial Justice,"(Formerly Law 715B) Recent events in our country have dramatically highlighted the fact that we are not a post-racial society, and that structural racism and implicit bias are as harmful to people and institutions as intentional discrimination. Currently, plaintiffs can only show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment - and several other antidiscrimination laws - by proving intentional discrimination. This seminar will examine this ""intent standard"" and its significant barriers to racial justice litigation. The course will review social science research, including studies on implicit bias, racial anxiety, stereotyping, and other concepts, to explore how contemporary discrimination manifests. We will address how legal advocates and the law can utilize such research to challenge and remedy discrimination through strategic litigation. We will examine real-world examples of this, including in the context of school discipline and the school-to-prison pipeline. Meeting dates: This class will meet on three Fridays, October 21, October 28 and November 4. Students must attend all three classes. Early drop deadline: Students may not drop this course after the first class. Elements used in grading: Written assignments (reflection papers) and class participation."
LAW 7044:,Supreme Court Simulation Seminar,"This seminar provides students with the opportunity to analyze, argue, hear oral arguments and draft opinions in cases that are currently pending before the Supreme Court of the United States. Professor Lawrence Marshall will serve as the instructor in the seminar, and several of the Law School's esteemed group of Supreme Court litigators are expected to participate in one or more of the sessions. The 18 students in the seminar will be divided into two courts. During each sitting, one of the courts will hear arguments in a case currently pending before the Supreme Court, while two of the students from the court not sitting that week will present oral arguments. The cases chosen will provide a mix of constitutional and statutory issues, as well as a mix between criminal and civil cases. Each student will be assigned the role of a particular Justice for the entire quarter. Each student's task while sitting on cases is to do his or her best to understand that particular justice, based on more »"
LAW 7046:,The Welfare State,"(Formerly Law 765) Much has been written in recent years about the decline of the welfare state. Numerous adjectives have been applied to describe a trend toward austerity -- death, demise, withering, reversal. One writer suggested that the welfare state had not died, it had merely ""moved to Asia"" along with industrialization. This seminar introduces students to the key literature, questions, and debates about the modern welfare state. We will consider the emergence, growth, and current status of the welfare state, primarily in Western Europe and North America. The course will examine classical theories about markets and the emergence of social provision. We will also consider the leading theoretical and empirical research addressing the emergence of the welfare state, looking at the American case in comparative perspective. Attention will be paid to social and political factors on state development including political parties, labor markets, gender, demographic change, and immigratio more »"
LAW 7047:,Rethinking Campus and School Title IX Policies and Procedures,"I apologize in advance for the fact that there are no paragraph breaks in this description. It is not my fault. Please contact me directly if you have questions about the class and I will email you a more readable description. Thanks, MLD. Seminar with Concurrent Policy Lab: Rethinking Campus and School Title IX Policies and Procedures. Policy Lab Client: National Women's Law Center: Over the past six years, the issue of campus sexual assault has exploded into the public discourse. While definitive figures are difficult to obtain due to the necessarily private nature of these events, several recent studies estimate that between 20-25% of college women (and a similar proportion of students identifying as transgender and gender-nonconforming, as well as around 5-10% of male students) experience sexual assault. Survivors have come forward across the country with harrowing stories of assault followed by an insensitive or indifferent response from college administrators, launching one of th more »"
LAW 7049:,Advanced Torts: Law and Practice,"Most of civil litigation is in tort. As society changes, this dynamism is reflected in the progression and regression of tort law. Taught by an experienced practitioner, this course will explore contemporary developments in the law of medical malpractice, product liability, mass torts, harms to reputation and dignity and other civil wrongs. We will consider a range of remedies including compensatory and punitive damages as well as their constriction through tort limitations. Knowledge of these substantive rights and remedies has greatest value if the arc and texture of suit is understood. So we'll also learn about insurance, negotiation, settlement and alternatives to trial. And we'll set all this in the broader context of how an attorney can guide a plaintiff or defendant to an appropriate economic and/or noneconomic remedy. Elements used in grading: Class attendance is mandatory and class participation is encouraged and valued. There will be a final exam."
LAW 7064:,Advanced Immigration Law Seminar,"This seminar is an advanced course on immigration law and policy designed for students who have taken the basic immigration law course or have equivalent academic or work exposure to the immigration law, the foundational constitutional principles, and functioning of the immigration system and immigration agencies. The class will explore a range of topics or issues that are not covered in the survey course. Topics may include: discrimination against noncitizens by private and public entities, workplace and labor rights of noncitizens, federal enforcement priorities and prosecutorial discretion, the intersection of immigration and criminal law, immigration federalism and ""sanctuary"" measures, judicial review and separation of powers, and selected contemporary litigation. We are unlikely to cover all these issues, and topic selection may be adjusted based on student interest and input. Guest speakers may be invited for some topics.

Over the past decade the issue of campus sexual assault and harassment has exploded into the public discourse. Multiple studies have reinforced the finding that between 20-25% of college women (and a similar proportion of students identifying as transgender and gender-nonconforming, as well as approximately 10% of male students) experience sexual assault carried out through force or while the victim was incapacitated during their time in college. Fraternities have been found to be associated with an increased risk of female sexual assault on campus. Vulnerable students and those from marginalized groups are often found to be at increased risk. This is also a significant problem in k12 education. Sexual harassment rates are even higher. Intimate partner violence, stalking, and online harassment are als more »"
LAW 7077:,Native Peoples and the Law (Reading Group),"This reading group of five evening meetings over the quarter will explore Native peoples' encounters with U.S. law as recounted in novels, documentaries, essays, and other material, emphasizing indigenous perspectives and voices.

LAW 7078:,The United States Senate as a Legal Institution,"This course will familiarize students with major, and/or emerging legal and constitutional issues concerning the U.S. Senate. In so doing, it will examine: 1) the Senate's nature as a complex legal institution, and 2) the issue of the Senate's legitimacy in the context of the current and largely unprecedented criticism of the Senate from all parts of the political spectrum. This first portion of the course will consider institutional-legitimacy issues facing the Senate, including the appointment of senators to fill vacancies as well as disputes concerning Senate rules and procedures such as the filibuster and holds. The second part of the course will explore how the Senate interfaces with the Constitution and the Supreme Court. It will examine how senators should regard the issue of constitutionality in voting on legislation, be it campaign-finance reform, internet decency, or health care. This part of the course will also consider how senators should approach proposed constitutional a more »"
LAW 7079:,Advanced Immigration Policy Reform,"This is a seminar for students with some background and interest in immigration and administrative law based on prior coursework, clinic enrollment, academic study, or other experience who want to engage in an examination of the administrative process for pursuing reform. The course will examine some of the current contested immigration policy changes and consider the mechanisms for achieving positive reform in light of administrative law and practice. The goal is to identify strategies and mechanisms for future reform that would further the protections of non-citizens during a period of global hostility to migrants. One significant part of the course will be contributing to a project that tracks and catalogues all the immigration policy changes of the Trump administration. Students will also develop proposals for future non-legislative reform through administrative action. The seminar will examine the federal administrative process from a theoretical, doctrinal, and practical perspect more »"
LAW 7080:,Amending the U.S. Constitution,"This seminar explores the legal and historical dimensions of the American constitutional amendment process as well as its current and potential role in our political system and public debate. The principal focus will be on Article V of the Constiution but we will also briefly examine the way in which the Constitution is said by some to be ""amendable"" (and to have already been ""amended"") through alternate means apart from Article V. The seminar will enable students both critically to evaluate the myriad aspects of constitutional amendments and conventions using proper source material and to develop their own proposals for potential amendments. The first part of the course will first explore the origins of Article V, including background on the comparative amendability of other written constitutions, the adoption of the Bill of Rights, and the apparent unamendability of the provision in Article V requiring equal representation of the states in the Senate. We will then review the history more »"
LAW 7081:,Family Law II: Parent-Child Relationships,"This course will examine the legal regulation of the parent-child relationship. The law used to be much simpler than it is today. The law treated marriage as the near exclusive setting for the rearing of children, defining the woman who gave birth to the child was the mother, and the man to whom she was married as the father. In recent decades, that simple legal principle has collapsed under the weight of social and technological change. The central social change is the reconfiguration of marriage and the multiplicity of settings in which children are raised. The advent of same sex marriage and same sex couples undermine longstanding assumptions about the legal definition of parent. And the fact that 4 in every 10 children are born to unmarried couples, and that nearly half of all married couples will divorce (often with either or both partners remarrying) introduce a dizzying array of possible family configurations. Advances in genetic testing complicate matters further, by allowing b more »"
LAW 7084:,The First Amendment: Freedom of Speech and Press,"Introduction to the constitutional protections for freedom of speech, press, and expressive association. All the major Supreme Court cases dealing with issues such as incitement, libel, hate speech, obscenity, commercial speech, and campaign finance. There are no prerequisites, but a basic understanding of American government would be useful. This course is crosslisted in the university and undergraduates are eligible to take it. Elements used in grading: Law students will be evaluated based on class participation and a final exam. Non-law students will be evaluated on class participation, a midterm and final exam, and nonlaw students will participate in a moot court on a hypothetical case. Non-law students will also have an additional one hour discussion section each week led by a teaching assistant. Cross-listed with Communication ( COMM 151, COMM 251), Ethics in Society ( ETHICSOC 151), and Political Science ( POLISCI 125P)."
LAW 7096:,Law and Politics of Bureaucracy,"Modern government is bureaucratic government. In the words of Justice Jackson, the rise of the administrative state is likely ""the most significant legal trend of the last century and perhaps more values today are affected by [agency] decisions than by those of all the courts."" This seminar will survey the major ways in which law and political science have grappled with bureaucratic governance. How do we understand the rise of the administrative state? Why are bureaucracies designed the way they are? How do bureaucracies work in the face of legal and political constraints? And what avenues are there for meaningful regulatory reform? The class is cross-listed in political science and the law school and course enrollment will be by consent of instructor. Students will be responsible for writing short reflection papers and a research paper. Students may take the course for either 3, 4, or 5 units, depending on the paper length. Elements used in grading: Attendance, Class Participation, Wr more »"
LAW 7097:,Educational Rights Workshop,"This workshop will be offered to students who were enrolled in the Spring 2020 Education Advocacy Clinic (which was cancelled). The workshop will consider historical legal and policy efforts to ensure that all children have a right to equal educational opportunity and it will look to the future of educational rights advocacy. This workshop will draw from past civil rights work, the experience of the Youth & Education Law Project, and the best thinking on how to move forward. Specific topics may include racial equality in schools, educational resource equity, equal opportunity for students with disabilities, Native American students, and other historically disadvantaged populations, and standards-based reform and expanded school choice as approaches to educational equity. There will be a weekly 2-hour, on-line seminar and discussion. All students will be required to write weekly reflection papers. Students may opt to write a 10-page final paper for an additional unit (3 units - section more »"
LAW 7106:,Judging in the 21st Century,"Since your first week of law school, you have been reading legal opinions written by judges. Who were those judges and did their identities affect their views? From a judge's perspective, what makes a case hard or easy? Did the process by which the judge was selected--or could be removed from office--influence her or his decision? How do judges make choices about the larger legal ecosystem in which you will practice law? After all, judges determine many aspects of the legal environment in which lawyers operate, from whether you can livestream a court hearing from your phone to whether you will take the bar exam in person or online. Taught by a Justice on a California Court of Appeal, this seminar explores judicial decision making about cases and the court system from a variety of perspectives. It draws from accounts by social scientists, lawyers, and judges themselves, analyzing what judges do and critiquing how they do it. The seminar examines systems of judicial selection, evaluation more »"
LAW 7110:,Record-Pressed Revolution: Black Auditory Advocacy and the Late Civil Rights Movement,"The movement had all but ended--Malcolm and Martin twin Moseses toward the new decade's Canaan, their people at once led to and lost in Equal Right's promised land. Two Kennedys and administrations sat lost to the threshold too. Tribute to the 60s--many hands made the law's lords work. ""The Revolution""--now sponsored by Black Power, deep base, and less faith--was underway, and everywhere. It would not, though, be brought to you/ by Xerox in four parts without commercial interruptions' or show you pictures of Nixon blowing a bugle. Gil told us. The old revolution was dead, long live the Revolution. Much has been written on the turn charted in Scott-Heron's Black Power anthem, expressing the sentiments of a community left to grapple with the consequences of a ""rights"" mission seen as, but by no means actually, accomplished.

LAW 7111:,Lawyering for Change: A Case Study in Efforts to Abolish the Death Penalty,"Over the past fifty years, there have been dramatic ebbs and flows in support for, and application of, the death penalty in the United States. Lawyers have played key roles in these shifts--through their in-court work and through other forms of organizing and advocacy. We will begin the seminar by examining the law and politics regarding the Supreme Court's invalidation of all death penalty statutes in 1972, and the central roles lawyers played in that result. We will then turn to states' successful efforts (advanced by lawyers) to secure judicial approval of revised capital-punishment systems in 1976. For the 20 years that followed, support for capital punishment continued to grow, and no state had come close to abolishing the death penalty. Over the past 15 years, by contrast, ten states have abolished capital punishment, and three other states have in place moratoria on executions. The number of death sentences imposed nationally, which reached 315 in 1996, has been 18 for each of t more »"
LAW 7510:,Empirical Legal Studies: Research Design,"Empirical legal studies have become trendy in the U.S. and are now spreading to law faculties in other countries as well. The popular image of an empirical study is that it involves sophisticated statistical analysis of quantitative data. Often the author of the study starts with a handy dataset and then tries to figure out what question he or she can answer using those data. Useful empirical studies of law and other topics don't start this way. Instead the researcher has a question, derived from theoretical literature or policy debate (or both) and faces the challenge of deciding what types of empirical data, collected and analyzed in what fashion, will best answer that question. The possibilities range from ""big data"" analyses of hundreds or thousands of documents, tweets or something similar to lengthy, intensive interviews with a few well-placed officials or informants, with just about any other way one might collect factual data -- e.g. online surveys, courtroom observations -- in more »"
LAW 7511:,Sociology of Law,"This course explores major issues and debates in the sociology of law. Topics include historical perspectives on the origins of law; rationality and legal sanctions; normative decision making and morality; cognitive decision making; crime and deviance, with particular attention to the problem of mass incarceration; the ""law in action"" versus the ""law on the books;"" organizational responses to law, particularly in the context of sexual harassment and discrimination in education and employment; the roles of lawyers, judges, and juries; and law and social change with particular emphasis on the American civil rights movement. Special Instructions: Students are expected to attend a weekly TA-led discussion section in addition to lecture. Sections will be scheduled after the start of term at times when all students can attend. Paper requirements are flexible. Cross listed with the Sociology Department ( Soc 136/236). See ""Special Instructions"" in course description above. Elements Used in Grading: Class participation, paper proposal, three short papers and a final paper (see syllabus for details)."
LAW 7515:,Law and the New Political Economy,"In this seminar, we consider key legal topics through the lens of political economy -- that is, is the interplay among economics, law, and politics. This perspective has had a powerful and growing impact on how scholars and judges view the nature and scope of law and politics in the modern regulatory state. We look at a range of topics from this perspective, including: constitutional law, statutory interpretation, administrative law and regulation, and jurisprudence -- all with an eye toward better understanding the dynamic interaction among law, politics, and social change. There are no prerequisites for this seminar. Elements used in grading: The final assignment will be a substantial research paper. Cross-listed with Political Science ( POLISCI 225L/325L)."
LAW 7518:,Social Science of Identity and Prejudice,"This a one-unit, Law Mandatory P/R/F course that grows out of the recommendations of the 2018 Faculty and Student Working Group on Diversity and Inclusion. The course is built around a series of outside speakers on identity and prejudice. These speakers will include the sociologist Lawrence Bobo (W.E.B. Du Bois Professor of Social Sciences at Harvard) and the psychologist Mahzarin Benaji (Richard Clark Cabot Professor of Social Ethics at Harvard). The lectures will be open to all members of the Stanford community. Students who wish to get course credit will be required to attend the lectures, participate in faculty and student-led discussions and write reflection papers. The course consists of 10 hours of lecture and discussion. The course is formally offered in the Spring Quarter, 2019 and credit for the course will be given at that time. However, the lectures and discussions will take place throughout the school year. The first of the lectures will take place on Wednesday, October 31 more »"
LAW 7809:,Advanced Legal Research: Litigation,"This course aims to prepare law students for research in litigation practice and judicial clerkships. More broadly, the primary goal is to enable students, now and later in their professional lives, to map out a coherent plan of action when asked to research a topic previously unfamiliar to them. Students should acquire a solid knowledge of research tools and a frame of reference that enables them to function independently and competently in the complex world of legal information. Students will accomplish the following learning objectives: 1) formulate rational and efficient research strategies incorporating relevant sources of legal information; 2) find and effectively use primary and secondary legal sources in any format; and 3) increase critical skills in assessing and the variety of information resources relevant to the practice of law. Learning legal research requires a hands-on approach, so students will complete in-class exercises and homework assignments -- all of which contribute to grading. There will not be a final exam. This course is open to Stanford graduate students with permission from the instructor."

LAW 7819:,Mediation,"As law is practiced today, attorneys are far more likely to participate in multiple mediations than trial. Mediation has become the preferred approach to conflict resolution in most states and many parts of the world. With the assistance of a mediator, parties can reach agreements at any stage in a dispute, in some cases avoiding litigation altogether, in other cases agreeing just before trial or when the case is on appeal. The course goals are to understand the nature of conflict and principles of conflict management, to develop the oral and written communication skills essential to effective mediation, to evaluate various mediation models and mediator styles, to practice all of the phases of a mediation and appropriate use of caucus, to consider the policy and ethical implications of the expanding use of mediation, and to develop the skills necessary to represent clients in mediation.

LAW 7821:,Negotiation,"As a lawyer, you will probably negotiate more than you do anything else. You will negotiate not just over cases, but any time that you need something that you cannot get alone. You will negotiate with your boss, your clients, your paralegal, and all of their counterparts (plus the lawyers) on the other side. You will negotiate with ""the system"" whether it is the court, the government, the structure of society, or the law. You will also continue to negotiate with your family, your friends, and yourself. This course is designed to: (1) develop your understanding of negotiation, and your awareness of yourself as a negotiator; (2) give you some tools and concepts for analyzing and preparing for negotiations; (3) enhance your negotiating skills through frequent role plays, reflection, and feedback; and (4) teach you how to keep learning from your own negotiation experience.

LAW 7823:,Advanced Negotiation: International,"This hands-on, advanced seminar is designed to teach students how to prepare for, participate in, and critically evaluate complex multiparty negotiations in the public international field. Through experience-based learning, simulations, guest speakers and case studies the course will expose students to various types of international conflict resolution processes, including natural resource management and extractive industries, human rights protection, ceasefire negotiations, and peace agreements. Students will strengthen their written and oral skills, counseling, factual and legal analysis. Special attention will be paid to the role of mediators and facilitators in such processes. Prerequisites: Negotiation Seminar, its academic equivalent, or experience in the field. Students who have not fulfilled these prerequisites may still be admitted to the class, but required to attend a bootcamp in basic negotiation theory and methods on Saturday, April 2nd. Please describe prior negotiations more »"
LAW 7825:,Advanced Negotiation: Transactions,"Advanced Negotiation takes students beyond the two-party, lawyer-client negotiations that were the focus of the Negotiation Seminar. The negotiation simulations are more complex, difficult and nuanced, and preparation time is significant. You will work as an individual lawyer or businessperson, in a lawyer-client pairing, or on a business negotiation team. You may be negotiating on behalf of corporate entities large and small, national governments, municipalities, unions and NGOs. Simulations may include critical-path supply agreements, founder/VC deals, cross-cultural medical device joint ventures, airline reorganization, big pharma global distribution deals, or multi-party private sector/government negotiations. The goals of the class emanate from developing your designer's mindset and a lawyer's instinct for effective, self-interested negotiation: from intense preparation for client counseling, to in-the-moment tactics; adroit response to changing scenarios; deeper work on persuasio more »"
LAW 7826:,Oral Argument Workshop,"Building on the skills developed in Federal Litigation, this simulation course will give students the unique opportunity to argue and judge pretrial motions from actual federal court cases. The instructor will provide the written briefs, and each week half the class will argue and half the class will judge a motion. Preparation will require reading the cases cited in the briefs and coming to class ready either to present an argument (attorneys) or interrogate counsel (judges). Students will critique each other both orally and in writing, and the instructor will provide oral critiques of all arguments. The goals of this class are: to train students to argue in court; to provide them with a chance to polish their public speaking skills and practice thinking on their feet; to prepare students to engage in challenging dialogue with both colleagues and future clients; and to improve self-confidence. Thus, while the context of the course is litigation, the objectives are much broader than th more »"
LAW 7828:,Trial Advocacy Workshop,"This lawyering skills course gives students an orientation to and constant practice in most basic pretrial and trial advocacy skills areas. Topics include: taking and defending depositions, trial evidence, including admission of trial exhibits in evidence and use of prior witness statements to refresh and impeach a witness, jury selection and voir dire, opening statements, direct and cross-examination of witnesses, and closing arguments. Students will try a full jury case through to verdict with use of jurors and usually before a real judge in the courthouse in Palo Alto at the end of the course. Students will also have a chance to watch the jurors deliberate and talk with them after their verdict. The course takes place during eight weeks of the Autumn Quarter with two classes (one lecture and one workshop) per week on most weeks from 4:15-9:00 PM, plus the final weekend of jury trials, Saturday and Sunday, November 12 and 13. Each day's ending time will vary; most sessions will end b more »"
LAW 7836:,Advanced Legal Writing: Appellate Litigation,"This course will give students intensive practice with legal analysis, argument structure, and writing in the appellate context. Through a combination of lectures, discussions, selected readings, and writing exercises, we will cover the most important components of appellate writing. The Lecturer will bring her practical experience in legal writing -- both as outside counsel at a law firm and in-house counsel at a high-growth tech company -- to bear as we work together towards each student crafting an appellate brief. The goals of this class are to deepen students' understanding of how to make compelling written arguments and to practice doing so in the context of an appeal on a cutting-edge issue. While this course will be focused on writing an appellate brief, the skills learned will be useful for all legal writing in a litigation context. Elements used in grading: Attendance, Class Participation, Written Assignments.

LAW 7848:,The Practice of Law or Not: What Lies Beyond Graduation,"This course seeks to explore a simple question: what lies beyond graduation? Within that question are a myriad of complexities. What does it mean to be an associate or a partner in a law firm? Should I do litigation or transactional work, such as public finance, whatever that is? Should I become a prosecutor or a public defender or criminal defense attorney? Should I go in-house and in what size place? Should I leave the law behind and pursue business or other opportunities? Those are not the only questions. To add an overlay that we all must address directly or indirectly, how is my being a person of color relevant to my decision and my success? In a world in which diversity is said to matter, as a person who is not of color, should I take that into account? What about being a woman or LGBTQ in the workplace? Or, what about being a woman or man who wishes to have a family? How does that (or should that) impact my decision? These are just some of the issues that will be explored. They more »"
LAW 7851:,Introduction to Legal Research,"This course will introduce law students to the sources and methods used in legal research. Students will (1) gain familiarity with core primary and secondary U.S. legal information sources, how this material is used, organized, published, indexed, and kept current, and how to efficiently find and use these sources; (2) build foundational research skills that can be used to approach legal research questions in any area of law; and (3) develop basic strategies to effectively use both familiar and unfamiliar research databases, sources, and tools. Learning legal research requires a hands-on approach, so students will complete in-class exercises, homework assignments, and a final project, all of which contribute to students' final grade. There will not be a final exam. Elements used in grading: Attendance, Class Participation, Written Assignments.

Program in Corporate Governance & Practice. The course, designed to be taken in conjunction with Corporations in Autumn, takes an economic approach to the analysis of corporate law. In particular, we ask why American corporate law has its particular structure. We will seek to understand how the separation of ownership and control produces agency costs, and the ways in which corporate law seeks to remedy these through techniques like disclosure, fiduciary duties, shareholder litigation, voting, and hostile takeovers. We will read and discuss ongoing debates among scholars and practitioners about the agency cost framework, the merits and limits of current legal policies, and the role of institutional arrangements like activist shareholders. We will also consider the relevance of these disputes, and the effectiveness of corporate law and governance more generally, in the context of more »"
LAW 8002:,Environmental Law and Policy Colloquium,"The Environmental Law & Policy Colloquium offers students the opportunity to learn about cutting-edge legal topics related to environmental law, broadly defined to include, among other areas, pollution control, natural resources management, and energy development. The colloquium meets in two quarters. During the autumn quarter, students will learn about core concepts that underlie the administration of environmental law, exploring ideas from economics, philosophy, natural science, and law.

During the spring quarter, the students will write and present their research papers. Elements used in grading include attendance and participation, problem sets, small writing assignments, and a final paper. This course is required for students in the Environmental Law & Policy LL.M. Program. All other students are welcome but will need instructor permission to enroll."
LAWGEN 112N:,Law and Inequality,"Most Americans know that discrimination on the basis of race, sex, and religion is unlawful. Seems simple enough. But advertisements in the back of newspapers still announce: ""Single White Female Seeks Single White Male?"" Isn't that discrimination on the basis of race and sex? Most businesses don't consider men for women's locker room or bathroom attendant. And why aren't those men and women's bathrooms and locker rooms illegal segregation? After all we know what would happened if some business set up separate bathrooms for blacks and whites. Isn't it discrimination for an employer to insist that men wear a jacket and tie and women wear nylons and a skirt? Why are some forms of discrimination unlawful and others not? Why is discrimination against short people, overweight people, or people with annoying personalities not against the law? We will answer these and many other questions by looking at court cases, legal theory, and philosophy. We may also have conversations with guest lectur more »"

LINGUIST 21N:,Linguistic Diversity and Universals: The Principles of Language Structure,"The human capacity for language is able to support a staggering diversity of languages. But is anything possible in a human language, and is there anything that is common to all languages? Looking past the vast surface differences, linguists have discovered deep commonalities among the languages of the world as well as strict limits on the observed variation and on what a possible human language is. In this seminar, we will seek to uncover the building blocks of language and the laws that govern their interactions. Our goal will be to reach an understanding of the ways in which languages are systematically alike and different, as well as of the nature of language in general. We will investigate a variety of topics, including crosslinguistic differences and similarities with respect to word order, the grammatical structure of questions, and how languages mark subjects and objects. We will explore the structure of both sentences and words, identifying and studying their fundamental prope more »"
LINGUIST 35:,"Minds and Machines (CS 24, PHIL 99, PSYCH 35, SYMSYS 1, SYMSYS 200)","(Formerly SYMSYS 100). An overview of the interdisciplinary study of cognition, information, communication, and language, with an emphasis on foundational issues: What are minds? What is computation? What are rationality and intelligence? Can we predict human behavior? Can computers be truly intelligent? How do people and technology interact, and how might they do so in the future? Lectures focus on how the methods of philosophy, mathematics, empirical research, and computational modeling are used to study minds and machines. Students must take this course before being approved to declare Symbolic Systems as a major. All students interested in studying Symbolic Systems are urged to take this course early in their student careers.

LINGUIST 105:,Phonetics (LINGUIST 205A),"Every time you speak a word, you say it differently than the time before. Getting all the movements used during speech production to produce an exact repetition of a word is nearly impossible. Your friends and family also vary in how they say words, and this variation differs across speech styles, emotions, and social communities. Imagine that. Our minds encounter thousands of different productions of a single word, but somehow identify it as one word, and not another. Phonetics is the systematic study of the articulation, acoustics, and perception in speech and can help us explain how different talkers vary their speech, how information from speech is used by listeners to understand one another, and how listeners store social and linguistic information in memory. Through lectures, class activities, and weekly lab assignments, this class highlights both the complexity of the physical nature of speech production, how we can understand the resulting acoustic signal, and how that signal i more »"
LINGUIST 140:,Learning to Speak: An Introduction to Child Language Acquisition,"None of us were born talking. We all had to learn it. How did we do that? We start the journey by looking at the perception of sounds before birth. We follow infants as they discover the sounds of their native languages. We talk about how the infant mind breaks the speech stream into words, phrases, and sentences; how it makes sense of language and uses it to convey thoughts and feelings. We finish by discussing how the majority of children in the world learn two or more languages at once. The course content will introduce you to major topics in child language acquisition. Assignments will help you develop skills in collecting, analyzing, and reporting empirical data. The class project involves collecting data from children at the Bing Nursery school on campus as well as the analysis of a large dataset of children's speech online. Class discussion and projects focus on giving you a hands-on experience with critical and scientific thinking."

LINGUIST 208:,Memory for Spoken Words,"Research on memory for spoken words altered the course of much research in phonetics and psycholinguistics since the 1990s. In 2019, though, we are facing three main issues: (1) Much work was unmoved by this seminal work, carrying assumptions that need to be clearly thought through and addressed, (2) We still have no clear grasp of all the intricacies and predictions of this earlier work, and (3) Redundancy in research exists, where parts of our field appear to be caught in a loop. This seminar will be reading and discussion based, focusing on work related to each of these three points. Students will be expected to read two papers a week (one course paper, and one paper cited within that work) to bring us to a clear picture of past work. In addition, the final project involves close collaboration between each student and me, to arrive at a novel and feasible study proposal that addresses one of these three issues, with the expectation that the study will be conducted in the Spring and/or Summer quarters."
LINGUIST 245B:,Methods in Psycholinguistics (SYMSYS 195L),"Over the past ten years, linguists have become increasingly interested in testing theories with a wider range of empirical data than the traditionally accepted introspective judgments of hand-selected linguistic examples. Consequently, linguistics has seen a surge of interest in psycholinguistic methods across all subfields. This course will provide an overview of various standard psycholinguistic techniques and measures, including offline judgments (e.g., binary categorization tasks like truth-value judgments, Likert scale ratings, continuous slider ratings), response times, reading times, eye-tracking, ERPs, and corpus methods. Students will present and discuss research articles. Students will also run an experiment (either a replication or an original design, if conducive to the student's research) to gain hands-on experience with experimental design and implementation in html/javascript and Mechanical Turk; data management, analysis, and visualization in R; and open science tools like git/github."
LINGUIST 249L:,Workshop on Incremental Language Processing (PSYCH 249L),"Language is processed incrementally over time. This has consequences for language comprehension, production, acquisition, and change, all of which occur at different timescales. What is the role of time in language? The class will be based around visiting lectures by major researchers in this area, along with meetings to prepare for their visits by discussing key readings. May be repeated for credit."
MATH 21:,Calculus,"This course addresses a variety of topics centered around the theme of ""calculus with infinite processes"", largely the content of BC-level AP Calculus that isn't in the AB-level syllabus. It is needed throughout probability and statistics at all levels, as well as to understand approximation procedures that arise in all quantitative fields (including economics and computer graphics). After an initial review of limit rules, the course goes on to discuss sequences of numbers and of functions, as well as limits ""at infinity"" for each (needed for any sensible discussion of long-term behavior of a numerical process, such as: iterative procedures and complexity in computer science, dynamic models throughout economics, and repeated trials with data in any field). Integration is discussed for rational functions (a loose end from Math 20) and especially (improper) integrals for unbounded functions and ""to infinity"": this shows up in contexts as diverse as escape velocity for a rocket, the pres more »"

MATH 77Q:,Probability and gambling,"One of the earliest probabilistic discussions was in 1654 between two French mathematicians, Pascal and Fermat, on the following question: 'If a pair of six-sided dice is thrown 24 times, should you bet even money on the occurrence of at least one `double six'?' Shortly after the discussion, Huygens, a Dutch scientist, published De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae (The Value of all Chances in Games of Fortune) in 1657; this is considered to be the first treatise on probability. Due to the inherent appeal of games of chance, probability theory soon became popular, and the subject underwent rapid development in the 18th century with contributions from mathematical giants, such as Bernoulli, de Moivre, and Laplace. There are two fairly different lines of thought associated with applications of probability: the solution of betting/gambling and the analysis of statistical data related to quantitative subjects such as mortality tables and insurance rates. In this Introsem, we will discuss poker and more »"
MATH 104:,Applied Matrix Theory,"Linear algebra for applications in science and engineering. The course introduces the key mathematical ideas in matrix theory, which are used in modern methods of data analysis, scientific computing, optimization, and nearly all quantitative fields of science and engineering.

MATSCI 85N:,Health Fab: Making Stuff for Life,"Semiconductor-based chip technology is all around us; in our phones, computers, and cars. However, not all capabilities developed for silicon processing are directed towards computers and mobile devices. A new field has emerged using these fabrication and patterning techniques for medical devices, health monitoring, and human-machine interfaces. We can now create chips that flow not electrons, but liquids, taking samples and performing analyses. These liquid based functions can be integrated together with silicon electronic devices for sensing, control, or manipulation. FitBits and Apple Watches are examples of the first generation of 'wearable' electronics, while more advanced devices that incorporate both liquid based sensors and electronics are on their way.nnIn this class, we will learn some fundamentals of device fabrication for biomedical purposes, take you inside the Stanford NanoFabrication Facility (SNF), and create microfluidic devices.

We will study the mechanisms and processes by which materials obtain the mechanical, electronic, and other properties that make them so useful to us. How can we cool water below freezing and keep it from turning into ice? Why is it that ice cream that has been in the freezer for too long does not taste as good? What are crystal defects and why do they help create some of the most useful (semiconductors) and beautiful (gemstones) things we have? This introductory seminar is open to all students, and prior exposure to chemistry, physics, or calculus is NOT required."
MATSCI 126:,Invention to Innovation: The Process of Translation (MATSCI 226),"Ideas need to be translated before the world recognizes and benefits by innovation. In other words, not all inventions end up being useful to humanity or the environment. The bridge between conceptualization and practicality is in translation of ideas to practice. There are several historic examples of close ties between translation and innovation in US history and in the industrial world. Translation is closely associated both with innovation and disruption. The class intends to address specific challenges including the following. The businesses on their path to innovation are strongly rate-limited by the translation problems of new ideas. Many of the inventions often do not make it into the market place or are disrupted at multiple levels in ways that are generally unpredictable. The class intends to provide an understanding how disruptive innovations take place in the context of the larger frame of translation and a framework for traversing this difficult path. In addition to class lectures, practitioners who have been involved in the process of translation in the real world will be invited to share their experiences."

MATSCI 302:,Solar Cells,"In the last 15 years, the solar power market has grown in size by 100 times while solar modules prices have fallen by 20 times. Unsubsidized, solar power projects now compete favorably against fossil fuels in many countries and is on track to be the largest energy provider in the future. How did this happen? nnIn MatSci 302 we will take a comprehensive look at solar cells starting from the underlying device physics that are relevant to all photovoltaic cell technologies. We will then look at the undisputed king (silicon based solar cells); how do they work today and how will they develop in the future. Finally, we will look at why past challengers have failed and how future challengers can succeed. This class will be co-taught by Brian and Craig, who graduated from the Material Science PhD program in 2011 and then started PLANT PV, a startup that developed a solar technology from idea to protoype and then full implementation on production lines in China. The lecturers routinely visit manufacturing facilities in Asia and work closely with engineering staff at the largest solar cell makers in the world to implement their technology into production lines."
MATSCI 384:,Materials Advances in Neurotechnology,"The dichotomy between materials and the mind has inspired scientists to explore the wonders of the brain with novel materials-enabled neurotechnologies. The development of neurotechnologies can be dated back to the late 18th century when Galvani used an iron-and-bronze arch to stimulate the sciatic nerve and evoke motor output in a dead frog. Modern neurotechnologies capitalize on the semiconductor industry's trend towards miniaturization, reading the activity of thousands of neurons simultaneously in the brains of mice, rats, monkeys, and even humans. All these capabilities would not be possible without the advances in materials science. This course introduces the basic principles of materials design and fabrication for probing the inner workings of the brain, discusses the fundamental challenges of state-of-the-art neurotechnologies, and explores the latest breakthroughs in materials-assisted neuroengineering.

MLA 339:,The Human Predicament in Three Masterpieces,"The human predicament is in many ways tragic¿or so argues the pessimistic South African philosopher David Benatar in his new book by that title. We are beset by pain and evil and we can eke out order and meaning only with sustained effort. In this class we will study three masterpieces in some detail: Paradise Lost by John Milton (1667), Gulliver¿s Travels (1726) by Jonathan Swift, and Middlemarch by George Eliot (1872). These three works take up the human predicament (¿all our woe¿ as Milton famously calls it) in diverse forms: political, social, physical, psychological, financial, marital, domestic. They are astonishing works that more than repay intense close study. We will take these great works on their own terms, first, and then in relation to the great questions of suffering, joy, redemption, and transcendence that they offer. Participants in the class are asked to read David Benatar¿s The Human Predicament before the first class meeting."
MLA 355:,Dante and the Poets,"Dante Alighieri has had a profound influence on literary tradition. Among his more active respondents were the poets. While the Romantic poets found inspiration in his blend of lyric and epic, of romance and dream vision, of allegorical pilgrimage and spiritual autobiography, pre-Raphaelite poets such as Christina and Dante Gabriel Rossetti (named after the Italian national poet) explored his use of gender dynamics, poetic authority, and the obsessive nature of love poetry. T.S. Eliot was, as always, a mixed bag, and at the same time as he was critical of a poet like William Blake, who illustrated all of The Divine Comedy and who was in his illuminated poetry in the visionary Dantean tradition of world-making, used The Inferno as the basis for his own deep psychological explorations in poems like ¿The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.¿ Prophetic poets like Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats found themselves turning to Dante in their own dying attempts at epic, those masterful fragments The Triumph of Life and The Fall of Hyperion, respectively. This course will explore the lasting legacy of Dante as a poet of melancholy, alienation, and redemption in the visual and verbal artwork he inspired."

This seminar will study five operas from the Romantic era in which star-crossed love is not merely forbidden but impossible due to illness, psychology, divine law, or the boundary between humans and non-humans. In addition to being gorgeous in itself, each work represents a different language and national style and a stage in the development of opera across 19th-century Europe. We will see how opera responded to currents in literary romanticism, folklorism, national consciousness, and symphonic music. Giuseppe Verdi, La Traviata (1853)Jules Massenet, Manon (1884)Richard Wagner, Die Walküre (1870)Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Eugene Onegin (1879)Antonin Dvorak, Rusalka (1901)We will study the five works closely, spending about two weeks on each, and read scholarly interpretations from musical, literary, political, and socio-historical perspectives.

He was way ahead of his time, and publicly outspoken, on issues like abolition (his mother and sister were conductors on the Underground Railroad), education for children, women's rights, Indian rights, what we today call 'ecology' and environmental protection. He was one of the first to translate Buddhist and Hindu texts for American readers, and was an early experimenter in a range of spiritual exercises: voluntary simplicity, self-relinquishment, contemplative solitude, and what is called 'extrospection' (seeing through others' eyes, including other species and what are often assumed to be inanimate objects like rocks and trees).

Technology is changing banks, financial markets, insurance and money. Like technology for medicine, finance is being rebuilt as machine learned code, algorithmic investment rules and regulatory monitoring. Risk models can be built to detect fraud and ethical lapses, or to open doors for them. Investment valuation models can optimize short term or long term returns, by optimizing or ignoring environmental and social impacts. Transparency or opacity can be the norm.

The globalization structure that we have taken for granted in the past fifty years is gone and a new globalization structure is slowly emerging. Instead of global supply chains and global markets, we may have strong regional supply chains and regional markets and weak connections between regions. It is not clear what the final structure will be, but one thing for sure is that the dynamic formation of the new globalization structure will be shaped by how companies and countries respond and manage the new inflection point through disruptive innovations.

ORALCOMM 123:,"Crafting Concept Albums: Big Tales, Small Grooves, and the Art of Musical Narrative","Cultures all around the world tell the stories of their history, beliefs, and identities through song. The Greeks set their epic tales of love, life, and death to music, Renaissance composers followed suit, and popular music artists do the same today. In this hybrid workshop-seminar, students will explore musical narratives by analyzing seminal concept albums and then producing their own single-story album through written lyrics. Students will examine how artists use craft elements such as setting, characters, and plot, cover art, and musical form and instrumentation, then apply that learning in their own productions. Creating music, beats, soundscapes, and artwork will be encouraged, but the final project need only be a cycle of recorded, spoken song lyrics. We¿ll focus in particular on narratives of race, class, gender, and sexuality and their social implications as we examine works from artists across musical genres¿from classic and punk rock artists such as Pink Floyd, David Bowie, more »"

OSPBER 77:,Understanding Intl' Politics Today: From the German Philosophers to Modern Social Science,"International politics is beset by problems. States go to war. The global economy is volatile and unequal. The human community is divided into multiple nation-states. Some states dominate others. People commit acts of evil. Luckily, we are not the first people to have noticed that international politics is not characterized exclusively by peace and harmony. War, capitalism, racism, and totalitarianism have all been subjects about which German thinkers - many based in Berlin - have made profound contributions over the last two centuries. Do their ideas and arguments stand up in the cold light of modern social science? What can we learn from them - and what do we need to discard? This course will introduce students to perennial problems in international politics from two perspectives: those of key German political thinkers, and those of modern social science. It is structured around five core questions: Why do states go to war and what could be the basis for a lasting peace? If war is unavoidable, what is the role of morality in war? How can/should the world be governed in the absence of a world state? How has international politics been transformed by capitalism? What role has been and is played by race and racism in international politics?"

OSPFLOR 62:,"Un)fashionable Entanglements: Development, Workers' Movements and Regulation in Global Garment Value","Fashion and garment production is an old trade, and it is one of Italy's most important sectors in terms of global prestige, cultural effervescence, and exportation. Fashion entangles creativity, culture, style, and ways of life. At the same time, garment production entails complex and globalized manufacturing processes that tie together segmented labor forces with differentiated levels of work quality, rights, and regions embedded in the world economy in diverse positions and at different levels of their developmental path. Garment manufacturing is an industry forerunner in terms of productive globalization, and it is considered a starter industrial sector for economically underdeveloped regions.

OSPFLOR 87:,What is Love? The Amorous Discourse from Dante to Ferrante,"Talking about love was the main reason humans ever began to speak in the first place. From the moment words were invented, they have been used to interpret and describe, in verse and prose, this powerful and mysterious force, in an attempt to interpret and describe our very selves. Lyric poetry was specifically designed for that, but even when telling stories about war, adventure, or the meaning of life and death, as well as when narrating comic or tragic events, countless writers have often endeavored to answer the question: What is love? By combining close readings of texts with a study of their literary, cultural, and historical context, and by paying attention to individual innovations as well as one's dialogue with tradition (a gendered tradition, that nonetheless stimulates fluid and even queer responses from the Renaissance forward), we will discover Dante's love, a means of damnation or salvation; Petrarch's love, which is sinful distraction, the source of poetry, and a path to more »"

OSPFLOR 106V:,"Policing, Punishment and Democracy: Beccaria and the Modern Politics of Crime","This course will ask how police, prosecutors, and prisons should operate in an open, democratic society, and what opportunities and challenges democracy creates for making those institutions fair, effective, and humane. Our entry point will be Cesare Beccaria's 1764 treatise, Of Crimes and Punishments, which linked criminal justice reform with the struggle against despotism. Beccaria was a key figure in the Italian Enlightenment, and his treatise laid the foundation for virtually all subsequent efforts at criminal justice reform, in the United States as well as in Europe. Beccaria's ideas heavily influenced the American Revolutionaries, found expression in the Bill of Rights, and continue to shape discussions of policing and punishment today. We will read Beccaria's treatise, as well as secondary materials placing him in historical context and tracing his influence on the reform of criminal justice institutions in Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

PHIL 1X:,"Philosophy Bootcamp: Truth, Reality, and Knowledge",What is truth? What is reality? Is science the only way to know about reality? Does philosophy provide an alternative? What are facts? Is it all relative? No prior exposure to philosophy needed. Intensive introduction to relevant contemporary theories and techniques in philosophy.
PHIL 2:,Introduction to Moral Philosophy (ETHICSOC 20),"What should I do with my life? What kind of person should I be? How should we treat others? What makes actions right or wrong? What is good and what is bad? What should we value? How should we organize society? Is there any reason to be moral? Is morality relative or subjective? How, if at all, can such questions be answered? Intensive introduction to theories and techniques in contemporary moral philosophy."

PHIL 20N:,Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence,"Is it really possible for an artificial system to achieve genuine intelligence: thoughts, consciousness, emotions? What would that mean? How could we know if it had been achieved? Is there a chance that we ourselves are artificial intelligences? Would artificial intelligences, under certain conditions, actually be persons? If so, how would that affect how they ought to be treated and what ought to be expected of them? Emerging technologies with impressive capacities already seem to function in ways we do not fully understand. What are the opportunities and dangers that this presents? How should the promises and hazards of these technologies be managed?Philosophers have studied questions much like these for millennia, in scholarly debates that have increased in fervor with advances in psychology, neuroscience, and computer science. The philosophy of mind provides tools to carefully address whether genuine artificial intelligence and artificial personhood are possible. Epistemology (the more »"
PHIL 24C:,Tutorial: Ethics for the Wild Robot Frontier,"Tutorial taught by grad student. Enrollment limited to 10. Robots and artificial intelligence present a new sort of Wild West. AI programs drive cars without a license; robots offer sexual services in exchange for payment; autonomous weapons systems roam around, looking to kill with impunity. With this new frontier comes significant ethical issues. There are several clusters of questions for us to consider, including most pressing: which technologies are permissible to develop and implement? Second, under the heading of what philosophers sometimes call moral 'agenthood': what would make robots themselves count as agents, and to what standards are they responsible? Finally, under the heading of moral 'patienthood': in what ways can robots be benefited or harmed, and how does this impact humanity's ethical obligations? Each week, our discussion will be framed around a pair of assignments: a short story, TV episode, or video; and a philosophical text. As we move through the course, the qu more »"
PHIL 24L:,Tutorial: Theories of Consciousness in Early Modern Philosophy,"Tutorial taught by grad student. Enrollment limited to 10. What is consciousness? Are all thoughts conscious? Is consciousness the same as reflection? What is the difference between conscious and unconscious mental states? In this class, we'll see how philosophers (Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, Kant) from the early modern period responded to these questions and revolutionized our conception of the mind. Readings will be drawn from both primary texts and secondary literature. Towards the end of the class, we'll connect the historical ideas with some of the most important issues in contemporary philosophy of mind and cognitive science. This class will be of interest to a wide range of students: philosophers, historians, psychologists, and cognitive scientists."
PHIL 32S:,The Philosophy of Inaction,"This course considers arguments against action for some or all people in some or all times and places. Is it always better to do something rather than nothing? Is it economically possible or desirable for our contemporary global society to do and produce less? Why should you get out of bed in the morning? Where do our normative standards and moral elevation of productivity come from? What are the best justifications for staying busy and active, and what are the gaps in these justifications? Does thinking count as action? What counts as ""overthinking""? Why have sages and religious traditions embraced living as simply as possible? To answer these questions we will construe philosophy broadly, sampling arguments from across the world and across history, beginning with how inaction is framed in Ancient Greek philosophy."

Concepts such as equality, tradition, and Hell have inspired social movements, shaped political systems, and dramatically influenced the lives of individuals. Others, like race, gender, and technology play an important role in contemporary debates in the United States. All of these ideas are contested, and they have a real power to change lives, for better and for worse. In this one-unit class we will examine these ""dangerous"" ideas. Each week, a faculty member from a different department in the humanities and arts will explore a concept that has shaped human experience across time and space."
PHIL 40S:,Introduction to the Philosophy of Science,"This course provides an introduction to some of the major philosophical questions about science. The first part of the course focuses on the role of values in a variety of sciences, especially in the environmental, biomedical and social sciences that have close connections with public policy. Question examined will include: Should values be involved in accepting or rejecting scientific hypotheses? Are certain scientific categories value laden? Are there scientific topics that should be deprioritized or not pursued at all in a society? How should scientists communicate socially important but uncertain information to the policy makers and the public? The second part of the course focuses on the scientific method and how it contributes to the success and progress of science. We will examine three different accounts of the scientific method, accounts that lead to different conceptions of the nature and growth of scientific knowledge: The hypothetical-deductive view; Thomas Kuhn's account o more »"
PHIL 71H:,Introduction to Aesthetics,"Aesthetics encompasses a seemingly special and particularly rewarding way of perceiving the world. Appreciating the beauty of a sunset, feeling moved by a piece of music, becoming absorbed in the composition of an artwork: these are all aesthetic matters, and they are all matters that lie at the heart of this course. We will begin by exploring core debates on aesthetic experience, aesthetic properties, and aesthetic value. But we will also venture into considerations of aesthetics in our everyday lives, aesthetic taste and our personalities, aesthetics and grief, aesthetics and gender, and aesthetics and race. By the end of the quarter, you will have a strong foundation in understanding this rich aspect of life we call aesthetics."
PHIL 77:,Introduction to Philosophy of Religion,"Is the concept of God philosophically coherent? If it is, can we know whether God exists? And if God does exist, what are the ethical implications? In exploring these questions, we will also have the chance to discuss God's relation to time, the possibility of reconciling divine omniscience with human free will, the epistemology of testimony and religious disagreement, the relationship between faith and reason, Aquinas' five ways, voluntarism and divine command theory, and the problem of evil. No prior experience in philosophy of religion or theology more generally will be presupposed - and students of all faith backgrounds (or no faith background!) are welcome. Readings will primarily draw on contemporary analytic philosophy of religion, though we will also look at historical works of philosophical theology from both Western and non-Western sources. Interested students are invited to contact the instructor for more information."
PHIL 82T:,Philosophy of Cognitive Science,"Does all human cognition occur in the brain? In what sense do we direct our attention to the things that we pay attention to? Such questions are among those asked by researchers working in the interdisciplinary field of cognitive science. In this course we will discuss ways in which philosophy participates in this interdisciplinary project by considering aspects of research on, for example, attention, theory of mind, embodied cognition, and metal representation."
PHIL 99:,"Minds and Machines (CS 24, LINGUIST 35, PSYCH 35, SYMSYS 1, SYMSYS 200)","(Formerly SYMSYS 100). An overview of the interdisciplinary study of cognition, information, communication, and language, with an emphasis on foundational issues: What are minds? What is computation? What are rationality and intelligence? Can we predict human behavior? Can computers be truly intelligent? How do people and technology interact, and how might they do so in the future? Lectures focus on how the methods of philosophy, mathematics, empirical research, and computational modeling are used to study minds and machines. Students must take this course before being approved to declare Symbolic Systems as a major. All students interested in studying Symbolic Systems are urged to take this course early in their student careers. The course material and presentation will be at an introductory level, without prerequisites. If you have any questions about the course, please email symsys1staff@gmail.com."
PHIL 114A:,Ancient Philosophical Methodologies (PHIL 214A),"In this course, we shall examine the philosophical methodologies that Plato, Aristotle, and the Hellenistics use and advocate. In Plato, we shall consider the elenchus and dialectic, in Aristotle dialectic and science. For the Stoics and Epicureans, we shall focus on the methodological differences that come to light in their epistemological disagreements and in their ethical and metaethical disagreements. For the skeptics, we shall consider whether they have a philosophical methodology at all."
PHIL 136:,History of Ethics. Central Questions in Ethical Theory: Sidgwick and Alternatives (PHIL 236),"Undergrads enroll in PHIL 136. The main ¿ but not exclusive - focus of this course will be one book: Henry Sidgwick¿s The Methods of Ethics, first published in 1874. This is one of the most careful, systematic, and influential defences of utilitarianism - the view that an action is morally right if and only if, and because, it produces the best consequences for all those affected by it. (This is a rough statement of utilitarianism; we will see how and why it needs to be refined as we go along.) For further details see the Canvas page."
PHIL 172C:,The Ethics of Care (ETHICSOC 172C),"Since the 1970s, a number of feminists, socialists, and virtue theorists have directed their attention to the importance of care in practical philosophy. In this class, we will focus on the ambition to employ the notion of care in systematic political ethics. We will address the relationship between care and integrity, care and community, care and justice, and the role of care in thinking about the ethics of economics. Students will be evaluated on the basis of three essays. There will be no final exam. All readings will be available online; no books required."

Once a utopian proposal, the policy is now discussed and piloted throughout the world. The growth of income and wealth inequalities, the precariousness of labor, and the persistence of abject poverty have all been important drivers of renewed interest in UBI in the United States. But it is without a doubt the fear that automation may displace workers from the labor market at unprecedented rates that explains the revival of the policy in recent years, including by many in or around Silicon Valley. Among the various objections to the proposal, one concerns its moral adequacy: Isn't it fundamentally unjust to give cash to all indiscriminately rather than to those who need it and deserve it? Over the years, a variety of scholars have defended the policy on moral grounds, arguing that UBI is a tool of equality, liber more »"
PHIL 175B:,"Philosophy of Public Policy (ETHICSOC 175X, PHIL 275B, POLISCI 135E, POLISCI 235E, PUBLPOL 177)","From healthcare to voting reforms, social protection and educational policies, public policies are underpinned by moral values. When we debate those policies, we typically appeal to values like justice, fairness, equality, freedom, privacy, and safety. A proper understanding of those values, what they mean, how they may conflict, and how they can be weighed against each other is essential to developing a competent and critical eye on our complex political world. We will ask questions such as: Is compulsory voting justified? Should children have the right to vote? Is affirmative action just? What is wrong with racial profiling? What are the duties of citizens of affluent countries towards migrants? Do we have a right to privacy? Is giving cash to all unconditionally fair? This class will introduce students to a number of methods and frameworks coming out of ethics and political philosophy and will give students a lot of time to practice ethically informed debates on public policies. At the end of this class, students should have the skills to critically examine a wide range of diverse policy proposals from the perspective of ethics, moral and political philosophy. There are no prerequisites. Undergraduates and graduates from all departments are welcome to attend."

How can there be truths about what is possible or necessary, if only the actual exists? Do we have free will? What is it for an event to be determined by its causes? Is the only thing that exists the current instance of time? Is the world purely physical? Does science answer all of these questions? If not, is there some other way to answer them?

PHIL 182B:,Naturalizing Content (PHIL 282B),"Meaning is mysterious. Right now you are looking at funny marks on a screen. Somehow, these marks are conveying to you information about a class that will be offered at Stanford during the winter quarter 2020. But how is this happening? These marks surely have no natural connection to the future class. They aren't like the footprints of a tiger, for example. Additionally, thousands of times a day, you manage to gain information about all manner of subjects by hearing strange sounds that have no natural connection to the subject matter. The sounds aren't like the bark of a dog, for example. You also manage to think about things that aren't in front of you, as when you think of a Hippo wearing a fedora. Yet activity in your brain has no natural connection to Hippos in fedoras (we presume). This class will investigate how it is that sounds, marks, and mental states manage to have semantic content. In other words, we will discuss attempts to solve the mystery of meaning, in all of its forms.nThe class is open to all graduate students in philosophy. Undergraduates who have not taken Phil 80 and at least one upper level philosophy class must receive permission to enroll."
PHIL 184:,Epistemology (PHIL 284),"This is an advanced introduction to core topics in epistemology -- the philosophical study of knowledge. Questions covered will include: What is knowledge?

PHIL 194M:,Capstone Seminar: Consequences for Ethics,"Should you always do whatever would have the best consequences? Plausibly, if everything else is equal, and the first of your two options will do more good than the second, then you should take the first one. But this principle faces a number of interesting challenges. Studying these challenges will yield insight into the nature of morality. The course is structured around three units. In the first unit we will study the structure of consequentialist ethical views. We will read the work of old dead masters and exciting new theorists. In the second unit we address questions arising from collective action, such as the following: do you have any reason to vote, or recycle, or protest, if your actions by themselves are guaranteed not to make much difference? We will address a related dispute in the philosophy of activism. The third unit addresses the relationship between actions and character. We¿ll address questions such as the following: what¿s so great about abandoning one¿s friends and family to attend to the greater good? Is it a problem if the best moral theory tells us not to follow it? By the end of all this, you will improve your understanding of ethics generally, as well as applications of related principles in economics, political theory, and public policy."

The nature of moral judgments: metaphysical questions. nWhen we say, and sometimes claim to know, that an action is right, or a person is good, what sort of judgment is this? We often say they are true or false, but are we entitled to say so? If they are true, what sort of fact about the objective world makes them true? If no fact about the objective world makes them true, then what makes them true? n2.

PHIL 363A:,"Seminar in History and Philosophy of Science: Democratic Science - of the Climate, Races, H2O","Is the Earth's climate real? Does it exist beyond experimental data, computer simulation, and scientists' writings? This seminar considers philosophical, historical, and anthropological perspectives on the reality of scientific entities. It asks how these metaphysical questions are connected to our democratic societies and our position as scholars. We will ask whether Homo sapiens is sub-divided into races and ethnicities in the manner of a census form. And how genetics should interact with our social understanding of human diversity. Further, can the answers to these questions stand alone as isolated academic questions, or must they be tied together with our political philosophy and social norms? If democratic pluralism leads to metaphysical pluralism, what becomes of long-discarded scientific entities, such as phlogiston? Some argue that pluralism upsets our most basic scientific facts, like: water is H2O. nnThis graduate seminar examines these scientific entities - the climate, race more »"
PHIL 375J:,Jurisprudence,"This course examines the diverse ways in which the philosophy of law bears on the practice of law. Our subject is thus a set of philosophical concepts, particularly legal positivism and natural law, but the approach is not purely conceptual. Rather, we will examine both the philosophical concepts in the abstract and how those philosophical concepts are reflected or actualized in the craft of legal argumentation, in the intellectual history of law, and in contemporary questions of politics and government. Above all, we will ask which conception of law best contributes to legal justice. The course consists in three units. Unit I is about theories of the nature of law, focusing on legal positivism and natural law. Unit II is about theories of particular departments of law, focusing on tort law and criminal law. Unit III takes a philosophical perspective on being a lawyer, focusing on questions of what principles define lawyers' role in society and what ideals give the life of a lawyer meaning. Grading is based on class participation, two in-class moot court presentations, and, based on individual student preference, either a final exam (a one-day take-home essay with a word limit) or a final research paper. Cross-listed with the Law School ( LAW 5806)."
PHIL 375K:,Criminal Procedure: Theoretical Foundations,"This course examines the theoretical foundations of criminal procedure- political, historical, and, above all, philosophical. What are the ideas at work in the American system of criminal procedure? How, historically, did the system develop, and why does it presently function as it does? Is the system broken and, if so, what principles should orient us in fixing it? This theoretical inquiry has a practical point. Procedure plays a major role in the present crisis of American criminal justice. By examining criminal procedure's theoretical foundations, this course aims to develop competing ""big picture,"" synthetic perspectives on the criminal justice crisis as a whole. Thus, for students interested in criminal justice reform, this course will equip you to take a philosophically richer view of the underlying policy issues. For students thinking about a career in criminal law, this course will equip you to engage in large-scale thinking about how criminal procedure should change, rather th more »"
PHIL 377A:,"Planning, Time, and Rationality","Intentions seem subject to basic rationality norms, including norms of consistency, means-end coherence, and (perhaps) stability over time. Such norms seem central to the planning agency in which intentions are normally embedded. But what is the nature and status of such norms? Why are they if indeed they are norms of rationality? What is the big deal about such consistency, coherence, stability? Is appeal to such norms an unjustified myth? What is the relation between such norms and theoretical norms of consistency, coherence, and (perhaps) stability of belief? Are there defensible norms not only of rationality at a time but also of rationality over time? What is the relation between such norms and agency? What is the relation between such norms and self-governance at a time/self-governance over time? Readings from Bratman, Broome, Brunero, Ferrero, Gold, Holton, Kolodny, Korsgaard, Millgram, Nefsky, Paul, Raffman, Raz, Tenenbaum, Setiya, Velleman, Wallace. Repeatable for credit. Prerequisite: graduate standing in Philosophy or permission of instructor. 2 unit option only for Philosophy PhD students beyond the second year; all others must enroll for 4 units."
PHIL 382A:,Practical knowledge,"When you do something intentionally, you have a special kind of knowledge of what you are doing. Anscombe called this practical knowledge. She argued that it is non-observational and non-inferential, and that it plays a role in making your action intentional at all. Was Anscombe right? What kind of knowledge do you have of your action when you are acting intentionally? We will consider various interpretations of Anscombe's view on practical knowledge, and various competitors. This class is open to all philosophy graduate students, and to other students only with instructor permission. The 2 unit option is only allowed for Philosophy PhD students who are beyond the second year."
PHIL 382P:,Grad seminar: Inference,"What do you do when you reason with beliefs or suppositions? What sort of mental event or process constitutes an inference? How can that event or process make it the case that one belief is held on the basis of another? How does it ground any form of epistemic responsibility for that basing relationship? We will consider various recent answers to these questions, including those given by Boghossian, Broome, Frege, Harman, Neta, Pavese, Siegel, Stroud, and Wedgwood. This is a graduate seminar primarily for graduate students in philosophy. All others need permission to enroll.

Often characterized as polar opposites - one advocating armed self-defense and the other non-violence against all provocation - they continue to be important religious, political, and intellectual models for how we imagine the past as well as for current issues concerning religion, race, politics and freedom struggles in the United States and globally. This course focuses on the political and spiritual lives of Martin and Malcolm. We will examine their personal biographies, speeches, writings, representations, FBI Files, and legacies as a way to better understand how the intersections of religion, race, and politics came to bare upon the freedom struggles of people of color in the US and abroad. The course also takes seriously the evolutions in both Martin and Malcolm's political approaches and intellectual development, focusing especially o more »"

How (if at all) should we regulate campaign finance? Should we even have elections at all? In this course, we will explore these and other ethical questions related to electoral participation and the design of electoral institutions. We will evaluate arguments from political philosophers, political scientists, and politicians to better understand how electoral systems promote important democratic values and how this affects citizens' and political leaders' ethical obligations. We will focus, in particular, on issues in electoral design that have been relevant in recent US elections (e.g. gerrymandering), though many of the ethical issues we will discuss in this course will be relevant in any electoral democracy."

Once a utopian proposal, the policy is now discussed and piloted throughout the world. The growth of income and wealth inequalities, the precariousness of labor, and the persistence of abject poverty have all been important drivers of renewed interest in UBI in the United States. But it is without a doubt the fear that automation may displace workers from the labor market at unprecedented rates that explains the revival of the policy in recent years, including by many in or around Silicon Valley. Among the various objections to the proposal, one concerns its moral adequacy: Isn't it fundamentally unjust to give cash to all indiscriminately rather than to those who need it and deserve it?

PSYC 20Q:,Human versus Machine: Artificial intelligence through the lens of human cognition,"This course will explore the promise and limits of artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of human cognition. Amid whispers of robots one day taking over the world, it is tempting to imagine that AI is (or soon will be) all-powerful. But few of us understand how AI works, which may lead us to overestimate its current (and even its future) capabilities. As it turns out, intelligence is complicated to build, and while computers outperform humans in many ways, they also fail to replicate key features of human intelligence at least for now. We will take a conceptual, non-technical approach (think: reading essays, not writing code). Drawing upon readings from philosophy of science, computer science, and cognitive psychology, we will examine the organizing principles of AI versus human intelligence, and the capabilities and limitations that follow. Computers vastly outperform humans in tasks that require large amounts of computational power (for example, solving complex mathematical e more »"

Commanders, historians, and politicians may view grand elements of strategy, logistics or tactical maneuver to assess armed conflict. But in close combat, soldiers on that ""thin red line"" face a rapidly narrowing set of possibilities as terrain, time and distance are focused to a point of brutal action. Psychologically this is the vanishing point of legal, moral, and religious proscriptions that have guided life to that point where, it is said, the soldiers becomes ""transparent"": all that one is or hoped or dreamt can be abruptly extinguished en toto. In this course we will examine the sociobiological, medical, psychological, and legal aspects of close combat: including the systematic preconditioning of soldiers for killing, the fraternal social milieu of the small combat unit and the impact on survivors who need to deconstruct that conditioning and social bond.

PM- psychiatrists, in addition to providing expert formal psychiatric consultation to medical and surgical patients in the general hospital, specialized hospitals and outpatient clinic settings, also train psychiatrists and non-psychiatrists in the recognition of normal and abnormal reactions to illness and appropriate psychological care of patients with such reactions. The PM psychiatrist may function both as a consultant and as part of the primary medical/surgical treatment team. Via conjoint rounds and teaching conferences (primary intervention), formal consultations (secondary intervention), and involvement in inpatient treatment and discharge planning (tertiary intervention), the PM psychiatrist provides more »"
PSYCH 8N:,The New Longevity,"Life expectancy nearly doubled in the 20th century. Along with a decrease in fertility societies are also aging. These changes have ramifications for all of the fundamental structures that guide people through life, including work, education, and the nature of families, as well as health, social engagement, and fitness. This course focuses on the implications for young generations today that will likely live longer than any in human history."
PSYCH 30N:,"The Science of Diverse Communities (CSRE 30N, EDUC 30N, SOC 179N)","This course is an exploration. Most generally, its aim is to identify distinguishing features of good diverse communities and articulate them well enough to offer principles or guidelines for how to design and manage such communities - all with a particular focus on educational communities like schools, universities, academic disciplines, etc., but with the hope that such principles might generalize to other kinds of organizations and the broader society. The readings range from those on the origins of human communities and social identities to those on intergroup trust building. They also aim to embed our discussions in the major diversity issues of the day, or example, what's in the news about campus life. nnThus the course has a practical purpose: to develop testable ideas for improving the comfort level, fairness and goodness-for-all of identity diverse communities--especially in educational settings. nnThe course also has a basic science purpose: to explore the psychological signi more »"

PSYCH 123F:,"Navigating a Multicultural World: Practical recommendations for individuals, groups, & institutions (CSRE 123F)","The world is becoming increasing multicultural, as groups of different races, ethnicities, ages, genders, and socioeconomic classes are coming into closer and more frequent contact than ever before. With increased cultural contact comes the need to create spaces that are inclusive and culturally sensitive. In addition, individuals must learn to live, work, and communicate in a multicultural world. How can we leverage research from cultural psychology to promote the best possible individual, interpersonal, and institutional outcomes for all groups?nThis course will serve as an introduction on how to create multicultural worlds and individuals.nDrawing heavily on research, this course begins with a review of what culture is and how itninfluences individual thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. We then discuss multiculturalism (e.g.,nwhat is it, what are some costs and benefits) before addressing how to promote optimalnfunctioning in multicultural settings."
PSYCH 125S:,Language andThought,"How are we able to produce and comprehend language in all its complexity? How does language processing interact with other parts of cognition? In this course, we will focus on several main themes: language production and comprehension, discourse, language acquisition, bilingualism, and linguistic relativity. We will explore these themes through lecture, demonstrations, analysis of empirical work, and student-led discussion. Special attention will also be given to the various experimental methods we use to conduct psycholinguistic and developmental research (e.g., self-paced reading, eye-tracking, cross-modal priming, and neural imaging)."
PSYCH 131A:,How to Think Like a Shrink (PSYC 230),"This course will teach you how to think (or experience) yourself and the communities around you as a therapist does. That means coming to understand why therapists focus on early life relationships and learning, why we privilege emotions, and why we see the seeming contradictions in our lives as places for deeper understanding. In class discussions, we will consider questions such as: How do our early experiences in relationships affect the ones we create later? Why are we more likely to segregate and point fingers when we are afraid? How can we make better use of our precious capacity for attention? What good might come from anger, sadness or guilt? Projects will include looking at how the psychological phenomena we will learn about play out in public spheres and personal ones. This is not a class about mental health, but rather about the intricacy of our feeling and thinking minds. The course will be discussion-based with a focus on experiential learning, and include weekly projects more »"

PSYCH 165:,"Identity and Academic Achievement (AFRICAAM 165, CSRE 165)","How do social identities affect how people experience academic interactions? How can learning environments be better structured to support the success of all students? In this class, we will explore how a variety of identities such as race, gender, social class, and athletic participation can affect academic achievement, with the goal of identifying concrete strategies to make learning environments at Stanford and similar universities more inclusive. Readings will draw from psychology, sociology, education, and popular press. This class is a seminar format."
PSYCH 176:,"Biology, Culture and Family in Early Development","Early childhood is a time of both enormous promise and vulnerability. Parents differ widely in their practices and beliefs about their role in enabling children to avoid risk and to achieve their potential for a healthy and productive life in the particular physical, social and cultural contexts of the communities and societies in which they live. In this seminar we will evaluate evidence from the biological and social sciences showing how experiences in infancy have profound and enduring effects on early brain architecture, with consequences for later language, cognitive, and socio- emotional development in childhood and adulthood. We will also consider the challenges of designing more effective social policies and programs to provide support for families in diverse socioeconomic and cultural contexts, who all want to help their children thrive. A community-service learning option, working with children as a reading tutor, is included for students taking this class for 4-units. Enrollment is limited and consent of instructor is required.

PSYCH 187:,Research Methods in Cognition & Development,"For centuries, scientists have studied the invisible aspects of the physical world---air, electrons, bosons---by conducting experiments and developing new methods to measure them. Psychological science is a field in which researchers use the scientific method to study how the mind works. The ways in which humans think, reason, and learn is not directly observable, so scientists need to figure out how to design experiments and develop new methods to measure and study these mental processes. Needless to say, the informativeness of an experiment critically depends on its design. But what makes an experiment informative? nHaving first-hand experience in the actual research process is a powerful way to gain a deeper understanding of the basics of experimental methods. In particular, studies with young children often require careful considerations of experimental confounds and noisy measurements, making them ideal (and challenging) test cases for acquiring the fundamentals of experimental de more »"
PSYCH 249B:,Topics in Neurodiversity: Design Thinking Approaches (PSYC 223B),"The course provides essential background about neurodiversity, the design thinking process and the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework to guide students in developing projects that maximize the potential of neurodiversity. Through case studies, field trips, guest speakers, and community engagement, students will explore approaches to maximizing inclusivity in realms such as education, employment, community and beyond. Students will use their knowledge to design and develop (or revising and enhance) processes, systems, experiences and/or products to maximize inclusivity and the potential of neurodiverse individuals. Based on student's interests and areas of focus, projects may include digital tool development such as app concept and design, redesign of standard processes such as job interviews/ candidate evaluations, design and development of physical products or spaces such as sensory-sensitive dorm rooms, ""stim tools"" and more. Students have the option to attend Monday classes or Wednesday classes for 2 units or attend both Monday and Wednesday classes for 4 units. This course is open to undergraduate and graduate students in all schools."
PSYCH 249L:,Workshop on Incremental Language Processing (LINGUIST 249L),"Language is processed incrementally over time. This has consequences for language comprehension, production, acquisition, and change, all of which occur at different timescales. What is the role of time in language? The class will be based around visiting lectures by major researchers in this area, along with meetings to prepare for their visits by discussing key readings. May be repeated for credit."
PSYCH 263:,Cognitive Neuroscience: Vision,"Decision, categorization. Bayesian inference, working memory, attention, cognitive control, conscious perception and awareness. The neural basis for all of these cognitive functions have been extensively studied in the domain of vision. Why vision? Because a great deal of scientific inquiry has delineated both the behavioral and physiological aspects of basic sensory processing in vision. Because of this, cognitive neuroscience questions can be precisely formulated in the context of vision. As a result we have some of the best answers to the question of what neural mechanisms underlie cognitive functions in the domain of vision. The course will combine lectures, in-depth discussions of primary literature and computer tutorials to develop key concepts in the neuroscience of vision and how these concepts have been built on to understand the neural basis of higher cognition. Familiarity with Python (or willingness to self-learn) at the level of being able to plot data and write equations from papers to simulate key aspects of vision models will be needed for computer tutorials."
PSYCH 279:,"Measuring Learning in the Brain (EDUC 464, NEPR 464, SYMSYS 195M)","Everything we learn - be it a historical fact, the meaning of a new word, or a skill like reading, math, programming or playing the piano - depends on brain plasticity. The human brain's incredible capacity for learning is served by a variety of learning mechanisms that all result in changes in brain structure and function over different time scales. The goal of this course is to (a) provide an overview of different learning systems in the brain, (b) introduce methodologies and experiments that have led to new discoveries linking human brain plasticity and learning, (3) design an experiment, collect neuroimaging data, and measure the neurobiological underpinnings of learning in your own brain with MRI. The first section of the course will involve a series of lectures and discussions on the foundations of plasticity and learning with particular attention to experimental methods used in human neuroimaging studies. The second part of the course will involve workshops on designing and impl more »"
PSYCH 285:,The Anti-Racist Psychologist,"Psychological science has been, and continues to be, an active contributor to systemic racism. This includes, but is not limited to, creating and perpetuating ideas that directly harm communities of color, excluding communities of color from the research process, and treating the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of white samples (and white scientists) as the invisible standard from which to judge all others. Students will leave this seminar with a deepened understanding of the historical and contemporary origins of such practices, and with a concrete understanding of how to practice anti-racism in their own research, teaching, and service."

When we debate those policies, we typically appeal to values like justice, fairness, equality, freedom, privacy, and safety. A proper understanding of those values, what they mean, how they may conflict, and how they can be weighed against each other is essential to developing a competent and critical eye on our complex political world. We will ask questions such as: Is compulsory voting justified? Should children have the right to vote? Is affirmative action just? What is wrong with racial profiling? What are the duties of citizens of affluent countries towards migrants? Do we have a right to privacy? Is giving cash to all unconditionally fair? This class will introduce students to a number of methods and frameworks coming out of ethics and political philosophy and will give students a lot of time to practice ethically informed debates on public policies.

PUBLPOL 314:,Justice in Public Policy,"How should we judge the fairness of social institutions? This is the basic question of justice, and it is a crucial topic for students of public policy. Justice, the philosopher John Rawls famously argued, is the ""first virtue of social institutions ... laws and institutions no matter how efficient and well-arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust."" Justice is an ethical question about how we as moral beings ought to treat one another, but it is also a profoundly practical question. All human endeavors require large-scale coordination of our actions, which we achieve through laws and institutions. But law without justice is merely mass coercion, neither desirable nor sustainable. In this class we examine some of the most influential theories of fairness in social cooperation, including utilitarianism, social contract theory, liberalism, socialism, and libertarianism, and talk through how we can use these theories to analyze, evaluate, and (re)design public policy.

PWR 2TSC:,Writing & Rhetoric 2: All the Feels: The Rhetoric of Emotion,"PWR 2 courses focus on developing strategies for presenting research-based arguments in both written and oral/multimedia genres. This course asks: How can emotions be motivating, and what can invoke them? How do the systems and structures that we navigate daily create conditions for anxiety or panic, and how do such systems respond to it? How do we understand anger in relation to ideals and social action? How is suffering and pain understood and treated? What is happiness, and should it be the ultimate goal? To what extent can emotions be understood as social or inherently human phenomena?

PWR 91F:,Finding Your Story,"Life challenges us to become aware of the stories that shape us--family stories, cultural mythologies, even popular movies, television shows, and songs--and then create and live our own story. We face this challenge throughout our lives but perhaps most acutely as we move into adulthood; this is the period when we most need to become conscious of stories and their power, to gather wisdom, practices, and resources for finding our own story. This class, designed with seniors in mind, will illuminate and explore these resources and give you the opportunity to reflect deeply, in discussion and writing, on what truly calls to you in this life. We will engage with some of the world's great stories--myths, parables, teaching tales, modern fiction, even aphorisms, koans, and riddles. In them we can find both elements that resonate with our own story and provocations that help us unearth and cultivate our native gifts--the genius in each of us. We will look at short excerpts from masterworks an more »"

PWR 194AB:,Topics in Writing & Rhetoric: Freedom's Mixtape: DJing Contemporary African American Rhetorics (AFRICAAM 194A),"Black music in all its genres, styles and eras has always been about freedom and transformation. About both Black people and the whole society. About the US Black experience, the African continent and the diaspora. These musical forms and the social movements they reflect and help shape are therefore central to the study of African American rhetoric. From overtly translating the ideas of social movements for mass audiences, to capturing the mood of a moment or move, to reflecting and influencing the aesthetics and styles that attend public discourse, to simply being a space where debates get worked out in community, music in Black traditions are as important a space of engagement as political speeches, sermons, websites, or even #BlackTwitter. This course will use Black music and its relationship to both social movements and everyday dialogue and debate to introduce study in African American Rhetoric as a field of study."
PWR 194CW:,Brave New Worlds: An Introduction to (De)colonial Rhetorics,"Since the time of Columbus, colonial agendas and policies have engendered their own rhetorics of justification and explanation. After all, European modernism began with the encounter of the New World, and Europe¿s own identity was forged in the process of ¿Latinization¿ of the Western Hemisphere. In response, decoloniality arose as a rich intellectual critique in the late 1990s in South America and the Caribbean. Decolonial rhetorical traditions stand in a unique position vis-à-vis the development of modernity, colonialism, racialized identities, the crisis of European reason, and the dawn of globalization. In an era of Trumpism, in which European modernity once again justifies restricting the mobility and freedom of Latinx immigrants, among other ethnic groups, perhaps no other form of intellectual critique seems quite so urgent. This course introduces students to primary decolonial rhetorical texts and asks students to apply these insights to pressing contemporary challenges by practicing deep reading of primary and secondary texts, preparing group presentations, and exploring creative acts of composition with an eye toward imagining brave new worlds and the decolonial rhetorical practices valued therein."
PWR 194KD:,Topics in Writing and Rhetoric: Technology and Human Values,"Pining for a job in Google X but a little afraid of what disrupting the next social system will do to humans when all is said and done? Unsure where the real conversation is happening at Stanford about how to think more carefully and thoughtfully about the tech we are being trained to make? Curious to know what underlying common ground might link fuzzies with techies, humanists with engineers, scientists with philosophers? These are some of the issues we¿ll address in this seminar. You will be able to choose your own current topic¿drones, tech and medicine, Big Data, Cloud applications, AI and consciousness, cybersecurity, tech and the law¿for which you will choose readings and write a seminar paper and then co-lead discussion. The class goals are to know better the ethical value of one¿s tech work and research and to be able to express to scientists and non-scientists alike the ways in which this work contributes to the greater human good (beyond strict convenience or short-term profit).

PWR 194KT:,Topics in Writing & Rhetoric: The Last Hopi On Earth: The Rhetoric of Entertainment Inequity (CSRE 194KT),"While #OscarsSoWhite brought attention to the Academy's overwhelmingly White, male membership, the underbelly of the entertainment industry itself is rife with inequitable hiring of not only on-camera and on-stage performers but also directors, writers, and others behind the scenes. While there are several organizations from Racebending.com to the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media that seek to usher in more equitable representation, push back against the Industry's disparate employment practices has been documented for more than fifty years with what many argue is not proportionally positive movement. White males still garner almost half of all theatrical and television roles and represent more than 80% of episodic directors while entertainment hubs Los Angeles and New York City are more than 50% people of color and female.

PWR 194MF:,"Topics in Writing & Rhetoric: In the Margins: Race, Gender and the Rhetoric of Science (FEMGEN 123)","Every day a new headline alerts us to the lack of race and gender diversity in the tech sector in Silicon Valley. At the same time, science and technology are often lauded as objective systems capable of producing color- and gender-blind truths and social good for all of us. This course pushes beyond the headlines and the hashtags to think about the complex relationship between gender, race and science. Together we will research chronically understudied voices and contributions in the history of science and technology and have the opportunity to read and participate in some of the efforts to highlight their stories through a Wikipedia edit-a-thon and final research project. We will also rigorously think through why the historical and current under-representation of women and people of color matters for the questions that are asked, methodologies that are used, and science and technology that is eventually produced.

All were born in a country that no longer exists, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1945-1992). This course will introduce masterpieces of Yugoslav literature and film, examining the social and political complexities of a multicultural society that collapsed into civil war (i.e. Bosnia, Kosovo) in the 1990s.

REES 221:,"Ukraine at a Crossroads (SLAVIC 121, SLAVIC 221)","Literally meaning ""borderland,"" Ukraine has embodied in-betweenness in all possible ways. What is the mission of Ukraine in Europe and in Eurasia? How can Ukraine become an agent of democracy, stability, and unity? What does Ukraine's case of multiple identities and loyalties offer to our understanding of the global crisis of national identity? In this course, we will consider the historical permeability of Ukraine's territorial, cultural, and ethnic borders as an opportunity to explore the multiple dimensions of its relations with its neighbors. In addition to studying historical, literary, and cinematic texts, we discuss nationalism, global capitalism, memory politics, and propaganda in order to understand post-Euromaidan society. All required texts are in English. No knowledge of Ukrainian is required. NOTE: To satisfy a WAYS requirement, this course must be taken for at least 3 units."
REES 227:,"All Quiet on the Eastern Front? East Europe and Russia in the First World War (HISTORY 227D, HISTORY 327D, REES 327)","Until recently history has been comparatively quiet about the experience of World War I in the east. Far from being a peripheral theater of war, however, the experiences of war on the Eastern Front were central to shaping the 20th century. Not only was the first shot of the war fired in the east, it was also the site of the most dramatic political revolution. Using scholarly texts, literature and film, this course combines political, military, cultural and social approaches to introduce the causes, conduct and consequences of World War I with a focus on the experiences of soldiers and civilians on the Eastern Front. Topics include: the war of movement, occupation, extreme violence against civilians, the Armenian genocide, population exchanges, the Russian Revolution and civil war, and the disintegration of empires and rise of nation-states."

RELIGST 1:,Religion Around the Globe,"This course surveys major religious traditions of the world in all of their complexity, in relation to philosophy and politics; liturgy and literature; identity and social hierarchies; art, community, and emotion. Through examination of a variety of materials, including scriptures and other spiritual writings, religious objects and artifacts, and modern documentary, fiction and film, we explore Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Daoism as rich historical and living traditions."
RELIGST 2:,Is Stanford a Religion?,"This course seeks to introduce students to the study of religion by posing a two-part question: What is a religion, and does Stanford qualify as one? Scientific, pragmatic, seemingly secular, Stanford may not seem at all similar to religions like Christianity, Judaism or Buddhism, but a deeper look reveals that it has many of the qualities of religion--origin stories, rituals and ceremonies, sacred spaces and times, visions of the future, even some spirits. By learning some of the theories and methods of the field of religious studies, students will gain a better understanding not just of Stanford culture but of what motivates people to be religious, the roles religion plays in people's lives, and the similarities and differences between religious and secular culture."
RELIGST 3:,The Religious Life of Things,"Temples, prayer beads, icons, robes, books, relics, candles and incense, scarves and hats, sacred food and holy water; objects of all sorts play a prominent role in all religions, evoking a wide range of emotional responses, from reverence, solace and even ecstasy, to fear, hostility and violence. What is it about these things that makes them so powerful? Is it beliefs and doctrines that inspire particular attitudes towards certain objects, or is it the other way around? Many see a tension or even contradiction between religion and material pursuits and argue that the true religious life is a life without things. But is such a life even possible? This course adopts a comparative approach, drawing on a variety of traditions to examine the place of images, food, clothing, ritual objects, architecture and relics in religious thought and practice. Materials for the course include scholarship, scripture, images and at least one museum visit."

Concepts such as equality, tradition, and Hell have inspired social movements, shaped political systems, and dramatically influenced the lives of individuals. Others, like race, gender, and technology play an important role in contemporary debates in the United States. All of these ideas are contested, and they have a real power to change lives, for better and for worse. In this one-unit class we will examine these ""dangerous"" ideas. Each week, a faculty member from a different department in the humanities and arts will explore a concept that has shaped human experience across time and space."
RELIGST 53:,Exploring Jewish Spirituality (JEWISHST 53),"It was once accepted as fact that Judaism is, at its core, a rational religion devoid of any authentic mystical tradition. But the past century of scholarship has reversed this claim, demonstrating that the spiritual life has been integral to Judaism's vital heart since ancient times. This yearning for a direct immediate experience of God's Presence, a longing to grasp the mysteries of the human soul and know the inner dynamics of the Divine realm, has taken on many different forms across the centuries.
This course will introduce students to the major texts--from theological treatises to poems and incantations--and core ideas of Jewish mysticism and spirituality, tracking their development from the Hebrew Bible to the dawn of modernity. Close attention will be paid to the historical context of these sources, and we will also engage with broader methodological approaches--from phenomenology to philology--regarding the academic study of religion and the comparative consideration of myst more »"
RELIGST 56:,Exploring Chinese Religions,"An overview of major themes and historical developments in 5000 years of Chinese religion. In this course, we will try as much as possible to appreciate Chinese religion from the Chinese perspective, paying particular attention to original texts in translation, artifacts and videos, all in an attempt to discern the logic of Chinese religion and the role it has played in the course of Chinese history. To a greater extent perhaps than any other civilization, Chinese have left behind a continuous body of written documents and other artifacts relating to religion stretching over thousands of years, providing a wealth of material for studying the place of religion in history and society."
RELIGST 117:,"Christianity, Race, and Gender in 21st-century America (AMSTUD 117R)","As the largest religion practiced in the United States, Christianity not only shapes the private lives of a large number of Americans but also plays an important role in public discourse, policies, and debates. This course investigates Christianity's place on the shifting religious landscape in America, with special attention to present-day movements for racial and gender justice in the era of Black Lives Matter and #MeToo. Students explore reasons for declining numbers of Christians in the United States, the polarization of Christian conservatives and religious ""nones,"" and Christian constructions of social relations. How do Christian beliefs and practices shape attitudes about race and gender roles? How is contemporary Christianity acting as a force for as well as a barrier to social justice? This course assumes no background in the study of religion, race, or gender and is open to practitioners of all faiths or none."
RELIGST 119:,Religion and Conflict,"Conflicts involving religions are among the most vexing challenges facing international agencies, governments, institutions, and - above all - humanity. Although religion is often used as a descriptor of a conflict (Jewish - Muslim conflict in the Middle East, Christian-Muslim conflict in Sudan, Catholic-Protestant conflict in Northern Ireland) the impact of religion on creating and resolving these disputes is not well understood. It is indeed difficult, and at times impossible or undesirable, to separate religious from economic, political, agricultural, environmental, and cultural factors. This class will give students an opportunity to delve deeply into the histories, causes, and cultures involved in religious conflict. We will also challenge the assumption that different religions or particular religions are prone to conflict or tend towards violence. By studying resolutions to conflicts and looking at cases of inter-religious dialogue and cooperation, students will be able to count more »"
RELIGST 134:,The Language of Islam,"Why do we as humans love? What is the nature of the 'self'? Is our experience of the world authentic and real? If there is an ultimate source of the universe, by what means do we access it? These are some of the questions which we will grapple with as we read a selection of the 'great works' of the Islamic tradition. Our readings (all in English translation) will span a variety of genres, including mystical manuals, philosophical tracts, love-poetry, autobiographies, and travelogues. While the lecture component of the course is designed to serve as a broad introduction to the history of Islamic thought and culture, our primary modus operandi will consist in closely and critically analyzing these texts with an eye towards their enduring value to the perennial questions which continue to preoccupy us in the Humanities."
RELIGST 139:,Religion along the Silk Road,"From roughly the year 1 to the year 1000, a vibrant trade route stretched across Central Asia, linking Europe, India and East Asia. Along this route, merchants bought and sold the silk that gave the route its name, along with paper, ceramics, spices, precious stones and any number of other commodities. Together with these trade goods, merchants, missionaries, farmers and artisans who participated in this vast commercial network, exchanged ideas, scriptures, practices and beliefs, including those associated with major religious traditions; Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, Judaism, Manichaeism and Islam followed the same routes as silk and spice. In this course we will examine the spread of all of these religions across the Silk Road, what happened when they interacted, and what this tells us about the relation between commerce, trade and geography in the pre-modern world."
RELIGST 141:,"Between Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, JR.: Race, Religion, and the Politics of Freedom (AFRICAAM 221, AMSTUD 141X, CSRE 141R, HISTORY 151M, POLISCI 126)","Malcolm X (El Hajj Malik El Shabazz) and Martin Luther King, Jr. are both icons of the twentieth-century civil rights and black freedom movements. Often characterized as polar opposites - one advocating armed self-defense and the other non-violence against all provocation - they continue to be important religious, political, and intellectual models for how we imagine the past as well as for current issues concerning religion, race, politics and freedom struggles in the United States and globally. This course focuses on the political and spiritual lives of Martin and Malcolm. We will examine their personal biographies, speeches, writings, representations, FBI Files, and legacies as a way to better understand how the intersections of religion, race, and politics came to bare upon the freedom struggles of people of color in the US and abroad. The course also takes seriously the evolutions in both Martin and Malcolm's political approaches and intellectual development, focusing especially o more »"
RELIGST 165:,Modern Jewish Mysticism: Devotion in a Secular Age (JEWISHST 125),"The twentieth-century was a time of tremendous upheaval and unspeakable tragedy for the Jewish communities of Europe. But the past hundred years were also a period of great renewal for Jewish spirituality, a renaissance that has continued into the present day. Beginning with the writings of the Safed Renaissance, the Sabbateanism, and the Hasidic masters, our course will focus on key thinkers in the 19th and 20th centuries, including: Hillel Zeitlin, Martin Buber, Abraham Isaac Kook, Abraham Joshua Heschel, and Arthur Green. Drawing upon essays, homilies, and poems, we will examine the ways in which their works re-cast and reinterpret the Jewish tradition in answer to the singular questions and challenges modernity. We will mark the development of their thinking against the two World Wars, the Holocaust, and the complex and multi-faceted processes of secularization. We will also consider the theological project of modern Jewish mystics in dialogue with modern Jewish philosophers (such more »"
RELIGST 180:,Gender Relations in Islam (FEMGEN 180),"This course investigates the ways in which gender identities and relationships between men and women have been articulated, constructed, and refashioned throughout the Muslim world. Starting with problematizing the fixed notions of gender and sexuality, we map the attitudes toward these notions through visiting a diverse array of sources from the Qur¿an, Sunna, and legal documents to historical and anthropological case studies, literature, and film from South East Asia to Europe and North America. We examine the notions of femininity and masculinity in the Qur¿an, family laws, and attitudes toward homosexuality and transgendered populations. We read examples of ambiguous use of language with regards to gender and sexuality in Persian poetry and mystical traditions. We study the dynamic relationship between Islam and Feminism in the Muslim world. Finally, we witness the implications of these attitudes in our case studies and stories, from a divorce court in Iran to a wedding in Sudan."
RELIGST 190:,"Bible, Politics, and the Internet","Why do some herald Donald Trump as the fulfillment of biblical prophecies? Does the Bible support building walls or welcoming immigrants? How about vaccines or mask resistance? The Bible is everywhere in American politics and public life, on multiple sides of every debate and in quite a few unexpected places. If you have trouble making sense of it all, you are certainly not alone. Sometimes public interpretation of the Bible is thoughtful and nuanced, but just as often biblical quotations are taken out of context, invoked inappropriately, or given meanings that contradict their original sense. How do we assess invocations of biblical texts and distinguish those with merit from those that are ahistorical and irresponsible? This course will strengthen students' ability to analyze, assess, and respond to the various types of biblical interpretation and invocation common in American social life and politics. It aims to bridge the gap between the academic study of biblical texts and their use in modern public life. As it is a Digital Humanities course, we will focus particularly on the Bible's use online and the use of digital tools in biblical research, ancient and modern."
RELIGST 226:,The Bible in Medieval and Early Modern Europe (RELIGST 326),"This seminar investigates the central role of the Christian Bible in European religion, culture, and society from ca. 1000-1700 CE. In the medieval and early modern periods, the Bible not only shaped religious attitudes, practices, and institutions, but also exercised profound influence over learning and education, politics, law, social relations, art, literature, and music. Students will obtain an overview of the role of the scripture as both a religious text and a cultural artifact, exploring the history of biblical interpretation in commentaries and sermons; textual criticism, study of biblical languages, and the translation of scripture; manufacturing of Bibles in manuscript and in print; the commercial dimensions of Bible production; illustrated Bibles, biblical maps, and biblically-inspired artwork; religious uses of scripture in monastic houses, public worship, and domestic settings; biblical foundations for political and legal traditions.

RELIGST 272:,Death and Resurrection in Finnegans Wake (RELIGST 372),"This close reading of Joyce's masterwork will unravel and reweave some of the major themes of this amazing and difficult literary artifact, including its complex fusion of mythological, religious, historical, and cultural strands. Finnegans Wake has been called a ""dream confessional"" and a ""titanic fusion of all mythologies"" (Dionysius, Jesus, Osiris, Finn MacCool) wherein the reader traverses the universal paths of sin and fall, death and resurrection, and everything in between. This offering of the seminar will focus on Book I of Finnegans Wake, with Books II-III and the Ricorso to be taken up in future offerings."
RELIGST 286:,Goodness and the Literary Imagination,"In her Ingersoll lecture at Harvard Divinity School, Toni Morrison probed the issue of literary presentations of goodness. We will begin with that very rich lecture, and a collection of essays by scholars of religion and religious leaders exploring that lecture in the context of Morrison's own work. We'll then discuss a novel by Morrison, James Baldwin's The Fire Next Time, at least one story by Flannery O'Connor, and related (short) works of literature and commentary. The inquiry will involve both conceptual and literary analysis, all of it focused on the character and presentation of goodness. (Limited enrollment; consent of instructor required.

What determines how individuals fare in these domains of life? How can we improve our collective and individual wellbeing? In this course, we will learn how our ability to pursue wellbeing is shaped by social factors, such as inequality, social networks, culture, government, and markets. We will draw on empirical research and case studies in sociology, psychology, anthropology, and economics. This course largely focuses on the US, but we will also discuss research from other countries in order to develop an appreciation for the role of social context in shaping wellbeing.

In the latter portion of the course we will examine the ways gender operates and produces inequality within a variety of societal institutions, including the media, the family, the workplace, and the legal system. This class will expose you to some of the methods social scientists use to study gender and help you think critically about common sense understandings of gender through a look at both popular journalism and rigorous academic research.

Du Bois, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Karl Marx. We will compare and contrast how they thought about important modern-day social realities such as capitalism, racism, crime, religion, and social cohesion.

Most generally, its aim is to identify distinguishing features of good diverse communities and articulate them well enough to offer principles or guidelines for how to design and manage such communities - all with a particular focus on educational communities like schools, universities, academic disciplines, etc., but with the hope that such principles might generalize to other kinds of organizations and the broader society. The readings range from those on the origins of human communities and social identities to those on intergroup trust building. They also aim to embed our discussions in the major diversity issues of the day, or example, what's in the news about campus life. nnThus the course has a practical purpose: to develop testable ideas for improving the comfort level, fairness and goodness-for-all of identity diverse communities--especially in educational settings. nnThe course also has a basic science purpose: to explore the psychological signi more »"

In this course, we will critically examine the idea of gender from a sociological perspective. For the first few weeks, we will tackle the big question 'What is gender?' To do this, we will begin by interrogating taken-for-granted ideas about the biological underpinnings of gender. We then dive into sociological conceptions of gender. In the latter portion of the course we will examine the ways gender operates and produces inequality within a variety of societal institutions, including the media, the family, the workplace, and the legal system. This class will expose you to some of the methods social scientists use to study gender and help you think critically about common sense understandings of gender through a look at both popular journalism and rigorous academic research.

In this course, we will shift our focus to the world our bodies inhabit, considering how our circumstances affect our health, healthcare, and well-being. We will explore the 'social determinants' of health outcomes, including neighborhoods, social networks, healthcare systems, inequalities, and power structures. We will also reflect on what it means to live a healthy life and the extent to which individuals may or may not be able to determine their own health outcomes.n nBeyond the substantive topic of health, a core component of applying the sociological lens is being able to use research to explain and analyze the social world. To build your critical analysis skills, you will read and engage with social science research and apply theoretical concepts to empirical observations. Throughout the course, we will engage with case studies, both in class and in assignments that ask you to turn your sociological lens to health disparities in the world around you.

Intellectual property rights (patents, trade secrets, copyright, trademarks design rights and so on) and data rights are a set of legal rights and assets that establish ownership of and protect tangible and intangible assets from copying and other acts¿for example copying of software or counterfeiting of designer handbags. Equally, intellectual property in the hands of third parties may pose a risk to a business developing a new product or brand. Most businesses start with an idea. It is critical to understand when and under what circumstances ideas, creative works and technology can be protected from third party use by intellectual property, and what limits apply to that protection. It is equally critical to recognize what must be d more »"
STRAMGT 514:,Product/Market Fit,"The premise of this course is the success of a startup (and even a large company launching a new product) is most dependent on finding a market that is desperate for its product. Focusing on product/market fit conflicts with the conventional view that a startup¿s limited resources should be applied to perfecting the execution of day to day activities. Interestingly almost every successful product driven technology company followed a similar path to find its product/market fit, but it was usually by accident. In this course we attempt to define the consistent process each successful company pursued, which in most cases is highly counterintuitive, and how to apply it to different situations. Our class highlights the potential conflict between pursuing a conventional approach and optimizing product/market fit. In order to really bring out this conflict, we employ a seminar format with only 25 students so every issue can be evaluated in detail. Our lessons are limited to information techno more »"
STRAMGT 516:,Fundamentals of Effective Selling,"The primary objective of this course is to introduce students to the fundamentals of how to sell. The course is appropriate for anyone who wants to understand and show proficiency with the skills required in different selling situations, both traditional (i.e., direct sales of products and services) and non-traditional (e.g., selling oneself in an interview, raising money for a new venture, convincing a job candidate to join your company, etc.). The course looks at the entire selling process of prospecting, qualification, discovery, understanding value, customizing presentations, objection handling, and closing. This is not a typical GSB case-study-based course. Students who have taken previous versions of this class describe it as a practical, hands-on, skills-based class. Students will work by themselves outside of class to prepare for group exercises and role-plays that will take place in class. These exercises are designed to give students practice with selling fundamentals in each more »"
STRAMGT 520:,The Industrialist's Dilemma,"This course explores how digital disruptions are having tectonic shifts on large, successful and established companies, whether they have a digital foundation or not. Both new and existing high technology firms such as Google, Amazon, Stripe, Airbnb and others are reshaping industries as disparate as life sciences and transportation. The management principles, competitive strategies, partnerships, and core competencies of the 20th century are being challenged in a world of bits and the global network in which all companies are forced to compete. In this course we will explore some of the fundamental technological changes impacting these industries, such as scaling assets without owning them, partnerships with digital leaders and new distribution strategies for goods and services. We will hear from executives of both leading Fortune 500 companies and new disruptors about what it takes to survive and thrive in this new digital economy."
STRAMGT 532:,Intellectual Property: Financial and Strategic Management,"In today's competitive marketplace, companies -- from Fortune 500 firms to early stage start-ups -- rely on intellectual property (IP) to keep them one step ahead of the game. Yet, critical IP decisions are usually made by lawyers with very little input from management. The purpose of this class is to provide business leaders with the tools, models and institutional knowledge to actively participate in managing and growing their company's IP assets as strategic business assets (with a focus on patents). This class will explore the value of corporate IP assets by thinking strategically on how to effectively leverage the knowledge, trade secrets, patents, technologies, trademarks, structures and processes that are critical across industries. We will focus on the elements of a successful IP strategy, and how that strategy is shaped by economic, technology, legal, regulatory, and market factors. Through a combination of case studies (including a group strategy project), analysis of current more »"
STRAMGT 537:,Leading Change in Public Education,"Public education in America is at a crossroads. Does our education system have what it takes to produce graduates who are prepared for college, career, and citizenship in our increasingly digital and pluralistic world? Will income and ethnic achievement gaps continue to be pervasive and persistent in our nation's largest urban cities? Will family zip code determine educational destiny for the next generation of students? Which strategies and reforms are truly demonstrating results and which are merely passing fads? As in all large-scale enterprises undergoing rapid, transformative change, leadership matters greatly. Fortunately, over the last decade, the reform of American public education has been led by a number of innovative and results-oriented leaders at the state, district and charter levels.

STRAMGT 545:,Taking Social Innovation to Scale,"How do you get the best new social innovations to reach the hundreds of millions of people who need it the most? And how do ensure that they are developed, deployed and scaled in a way that is relevant, appropriate and sustainable? Innovators tackling the world's most difficult problems often ignore, misunderstand, and under-invest in the critical business challenges involved in crossing ""the middle of the value chain."" This is innovation's valley of death: product and system adaption and evaluation; evidence generation and design validation; business and partnership planning; formal or informal regulatory approval and registration. How do you design, introduce, and optimize the intervention's uptake before it can be taken to scale by markets, governments or other systems?

STRAMGT 547:,Riding The Next Wave in Developing Economies,"Today, innovative ventures in developing economies are providing compelling new products and services to a growing middle-class as well as to the lower part of the economic pyramid. These offerings provide consumers ways to better their lives and companies to grow their businesses. As older industries around the world are being disrupted, and entrepreneurial ecosystems in developing economies are evolving, entrepreneurs and investors now have reference points and ¿basecamps¿ to explore unique opportunities. These newly formed networks that include universities, incubators, accelerator programs, angel investor organizations and small venture capital firms are still lacking in breadth and depth, despite their attempts to follow the lead of Silicon Valley. Consequently, investors and founders face distinct and more numerous challenges that they would not encounter in Silicon Valley, such as small local markets, lack of scale-up funding, uncertain exit opportunities, inadequate talent pool more »"

STS 200J:,"Technometabolism: Technology, Society, and the Anthropocene","The technosphere - the global sum of all infrastructure - metabolizes energy, materials, and information to feed human consumption. It runs on fossil fuels and solar energy, metabolized through such processes as photosynthesis (agriculture), photovoltaics, wind, and hydroelectric power. The technosphere also metabolizes information, ingesting some kinds of data as inputs and producing other data as outputs. Techno-metabolism's waste products, such as greenhouse gases, microplastics, and nuclear waste, are currently transforming the atmosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere, with radically different effects on disparate peoples and places. Scientists, historians, engineers, and others have proposed new ways to conceptualize techno-metabolism, seeking to reduce its energy requirements and material waste. In this group-project-centered course, students will develop creative ways to visualize, understand, and change the interplay of energy, materials, and information to respond to environmental crises in the Anthropocene era."
SURG 52Q:,Becoming whatever you want to be: lessons learned from a stem cell,"Stem cells are extreme: they are the most powerful cells in our body and yet they are unimaginably scarce; they exist in nearly every tissue but actually locating them is enormously challenging. We believe that stem cells have the potential to transform the way we practice medicine, while at the same time their potential application to human disease continues to spark political debates around the world. My laboratory at Stanford works on this remarkable cell, and we believe that they hold answers to some of the pressing questions about the potential for tissue healing and regeneration in our bodies. Come join us in this conversation about stem cells, and both the hype and hope that surrounds their application to medical practice.While we will be focusing on the human body, we encourage participation from those students whose fields of interest fall well outside HumBio.

SUSTAIN 328:,Policy Practicum: Integrating Water and Land Use Policy in the West: The Missing Link,"The western United States is currently experiencing what may be the longest and most severe ""megadrought"" in modern U.S. history. Current U.S. drought data shows virtually all of the Southwest in severe, extreme, or extraordinary drought. Reservoirs on the Colorado River are reaching record lows, and many farmers throughout the West have had their deliveries cut dramatically or face potentially massive cutbacks. Media discussion of episodic, emergency ""droughts"" has been replaced by a recognition of the permanent ""aridification"" of the West under climate change. Resolving the West's growing water crisis will require far greater linkage of water management and land use. Land use drives water demand, while water availability constrains land use. While water and land use are integrally related in fact, water and land-use policies in practice are far from integrated.

Oregon, Washington and Colorado all suffered similar ""airpocalypse"" fire seasons. Recent model-based estimates of mortality from wildfire smoke-derived particulate matter suggest that between 1200 and 3000 seniors likely died from the fires this summer.

Will the explanation be the same in both cases, or do statements follow from assumptions for a variety of different reasons? Are there laws or principles which conclusively prove the statements from the assumptions? Can these laws be doubted, or are they self-evident?nThe Logic Group will tackle these and similar questions. You will gain a solid understanding of both propositional and predicate logic, including a deductive proof system. You will familiarise yourself with the central concepts of formal reasoning, including syntax and semantics, truth and interpretation, validity and soundness, and the concept of logical consequence. Although formal and technical, the course is accessible to all students, and all may benefit.

SYMSYS 195L:,Methods in Psycholinguistics (LINGUIST 245B),"Over the past ten years, linguists have become increasingly interested in testing theories with a wider range of empirical data than the traditionally accepted introspective judgments of hand-selected linguistic examples. Consequently, linguistics has seen a surge of interest in psycholinguistic methods across all subfields. This course will provide an overview of various standard psycholinguistic techniques and measures, including offline judgments (e.g., binary categorization tasks like truth-value judgments, Likert scale ratings, continuous slider ratings), response times, reading times, eye-tracking, ERPs, and corpus methods. Students will present and discuss research articles. Students will also run an experiment (either a replication or an original design, if conducive to the student's research) to gain hands-on experience with experimental design and implementation in html/javascript and Mechanical Turk; data management, analysis, and visualization in R; and open science tools like git/github."

SYMSYS 208:,Computer Machines and Intelligence,"It has become common for us to see in the media news about computer winning a masters in chess, or answering questions on the Jeopardy TV show, or the impact of AI on health, transportation, education, in the labor market and even as an existential threat to mankind. This interest in AI gives rise questions such as: Is it possible for a computer to think? What is thought? Are we computers? Could machines feel emotions or be conscious? Curiously, there is no single, universally accepted definition of Artificial Intelligence. However in view of the rapid dissemination of AI these questions are important not only for experts, but also for all other members of society. This course is intended for students from different majors Interested in learn how the concept of intelligent machine is understood by the researchers in AI.

TAPS 22N:,"Culture, Conflict, and the Modern Middle East","In this course, you will encounter the Middle East through places, peoples, and performances, beyond the basic study of identifying the region and learning its history. The main question that we will contend with is: how can one achieve an ideal encounter with a people? Through experience and experimentation, we will attempt to approach the region from different angles, perspectives, and disciplines. You can expect to be surprised again and again as we find ways to see, hear, touch, smell, and taste the Middle East through carefully curated readings, viewings, practices, assignments, and events, each teaching us a different way of thinking, creating, and living. Yet, in all these encounters, the theme of performance will return to remind us that knowledge of ourselves and the other is but a tangible exhibit of performances of everyday life. From virtually visiting architectural wonders such as Petra and the Pyramids, to encountering classic literatures such as the Arabian Nights, to fi more »"
TAPS 23N:,"How to Create A Ghost: Theater, Magic, and Technology","How do you conjure a ghost? Fly a bird? Make a person disappear? And why? What is the appeal of magic, illusions, and technological tricks? This course will explore the history of magic through its theatrical history, exploring important relationships between culture, technological innovation, and illusion-making. From traps, to lifts, to sugar glass props, the stage has absorbed and utilized technological and scientific innovations to create its illusions, narratives, and stories. Techniques of magic and stagecraft have been used since the sixteenth century to imagine other worlds. In creating these illusions, the theater also negotiated with emerging scientific theories and concepts. We will ask: What relationship does magic and theater have to the stories we tell? What contribution did technological innovations have on illusion making? How did theater makers develop and innovate using technological and scientific theories? What role does technological aesthetics play in understandin more »"

One field trip to a professional theater may be planned."
TAPS 136V:,Design for Movement & Music,"From Beethoven to Beyonce, music inspires us. It rushes through our body, mind, and soul, inspiring us to move and be moved. Choreographers like Twyla, Taylor, and Todrick have us all express ourselves in different and amazing ways. Almost as important as how they move, is how they look doing it. Michael Jackson¿s jacket in Thriller, Liza Minnelli¿s bowler cap and chair in Cabaret, the lighting in Janet Jackson¿s Rhythm Nation...all design choices that have shaped our memories of these performances. A strong and thoughtful design can emphasize a moment within a performance causing a stir in the subconscious of its observer creating a lasting impression. The intention of this course is to push past the page and learn design and practices for non-play/musical/opera live production. From circus, to dance, to music festivals, this course will focus on research, concept, design, and implementation for these live performances."
TAPS 139:,Pacific Ocean Worlds: A Sea of Islands (HUMCORE 139),"How do we think about the modern Pacific Ocean world? Here in California, we border this vast waterscape, which is larger than all the world's remaining oceans combined and which could easily fit all of the planet's landmasses within it. What lessons can we learn from the region's diverse and dynamic island cultures, its entangled histories, and its urgent contemporary issues? How has the Pacific impacted ideas about modernity elsewhere in the world? And what unique Oceanian modernities are emerging from the region? Engaging with a rich array of literary and performance texts, films, and artworks from the 19th to the 21st centuries, we will consider different ways in which the Pacific has been imagined. We will further explore how Pacific Islander scholars, artists, and activists have drawn on their cultural traditions and knowledge systems to create new works that respond to current challenges facing the region, including colonialism, globalization, tourism, migration, climate change, militarization, and nuclearization.

TAPS 151:,Dramaturgy (TAPS 315),"Dramaturgy is one of the most transferable skills in performing arts. With its integration of scholarly research and creative practice, dramaturgy is in a position to augment all other areas of performance. For example, more often than not a good director or a good choreographer is also a good dramaturg: an ability to analyze, adapt, and transform an existing dramatic text or weave devised actions into a narrative is essential for the success of a performance; likewise, acting becomes greatly enriched by performers' ability to grasp internal workings of a dramatic text; finally, any kind of design (stage, costume, light, or digital) benefits from skillful plotting of the story through images and sounds. In this class, students will get acquainted with theoretical and historical sources of dramaturgy and explore procedures and techniques they can use in their work on productions."

THINK 15:,How Does Your Brain Work?,"How do the biology and chemistry of the brain create the mind that lets us talk, walk, laugh, love, learn, remember, and forget? What can neuroscience say about what makes us human? How can we ask questions about the brain that are observable, testable, and answerable? The human brain is the most complex organ we know. To understand the biology of brain function, this course will use highly interactive lectures and discussions to examine the validity of common beliefs about the brain, discuss how the brain and the nervous system are organized, how individual elements of the brain function, and how together these units produce action. The brain, like all other biological structures, has evolved over time in response to natural selection by adapting to diverse behavioral and environmental constraints. We use evolutionary comparisons to illuminate important questions about brain function, including what the origins and consequences of brain damage are, how and where drugs act, and how you collect, interpret, and understand information about the world. You will learn both how the science of the brain has emerged through understanding important experiments and observations and how you can formulate and test your own experimental questions about the brain."

In the 2010s, it is just 1 in 150. This course tries to explain this astonishing shift away from violence. We will look at the history of war from the Stone Age to the robot age, including the conflicts of the 2010s; and we will draw on everything from anthropology and archaeology to biology and psychology, as we try to answer one of the biggest questions of all: will there ever be a world without war?
